# String Validator Application

This application validates a string based on specific rules regarding character positions and types. It ensures that the input string adheres to the defined criteria and provides feedback accordingly.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: The application checks if the input string length is between 1 and 100 characters.
- **Character Validation**: It verifies that characters at even indices are either 'L', 'U', or 'D', and characters at odd indices are either 'R', 'U', or 'D'.
- **Output**: The application outputs "Yes" if the string is deemed easily playable according to the rules, otherwise it outputs "No".

## Quick Install

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can create one with the following content (this is just a placeholder; add actual dependencies as needed):

```
# Add your dependencies here
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt. You can do this by navigating to the directory where `main.py` is located and running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the String**: When prompted, enter a string that you want to validate. Ensure that the string length is between 1 and 100 characters.

3. **View the Result**: After entering the string, the application will process it and print either "Yes" or "No" based on the validation rules.

### Example Usage

- **Valid Input**: 
   - Input: `RUDL`
   - Output: `Yes`
  
- **Invalid Input**: 
   - Input: `RUDX`
   - Output: `No` (because 'X' is not a valid character)

## Important Notes

- The application currently does not support graphical user interface (GUI) input or output. It operates entirely through the command line.
- Ensure that you only use the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D' in your input string, as any other character will result in an invalid input message.

## Conclusion

This application serves as a simple yet effective tool for validating strings based on specific character rules. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
