Task:
Receive the string 'S' from standard input, ensuring its length is between 1 and 100 characters. Initialize a boolean variable 'is_easily_playable' and set it to 'True'. Loop through each character in 'S' using its index:\n   - For odd indices (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...), check if the character is one of 'R', 'U', or 'D'.\n     - If not, set 'is_easily_playable' to 'False' and break the loop.\n   - For even indices (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...), check if the character is one of 'L', 'U', or 'D'.\n     - If not, set 'is_easily_playable' to 'False' and break the loop. After the loop, check the value of 'is_easily_playable'. If 'is_easily_playable' is 'True', prepare to print 'Yes'; otherwise, prepare to print 'No'. Print the result ('Yes' or 'No').
