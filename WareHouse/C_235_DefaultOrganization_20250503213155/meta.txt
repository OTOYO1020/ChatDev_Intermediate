Task:
Read integers N and Q from standard input. Read the sequence of integers A of length N. Initialize a dictionary 'occurrences' to store the indices of each number in A. Populate 'occurrences' by iterating through A and appending the index of each number to its corresponding list in the dictionary. For each query i from 1 to Q, read the pair of integers (x_i, k_i). Check if x_i exists in the 'occurrences' dictionary:\n   - If it exists, retrieve the list of indices for x_i.\n   - If the length of the list is less than k_i, print -1 (not enough occurrences).\n   - Otherwise, print the (k_i - 1)-th index from the list (adjusting for 0-based indexing). Print the results for all queries.
