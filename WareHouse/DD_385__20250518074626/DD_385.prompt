Define the function 'find_final_position_and_houses(N: int, houses: List[Tuple[int, int]], M: int, movements: List[Tuple[str, int]], S: Tuple[int, int])' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the number of houses 'N', their coordinates 'houses', the number of movements 'M', the movement instructions 'movements', and Santa's starting position 'S'. Initialize a set to keep track of distinct houses that Santa passes through or arrives at during his movements. Set Santa's initial position to the coordinates provided in 'S'. Iterate over each movement in 'movements', updating Santa's position based on the direction 'D_i' and distance 'C_i'. For each movement, check if the new position corresponds to any house in 'houses' and add it to the set of distinct houses if it does. Ensure to handle movements that may pass through multiple house coordinates by calculating the intermediate points between Santa's current position and the new position. After processing all movements, determine the final position of Santa and the count of distinct houses from the set. Return the final position as a tuple and the count of distinct houses as a tuple from the function. Format the output to display the final position and the number of distinct houses passed through.
