Define the function 'min_moves(s_x, s_y, g_x, g_y, obstacles)' to handle the input parameters representing the starting position, goal position, and list of obstacles. Parse the input to extract integers H, W, N, s_x, s_y, g_x, g_y, and the list of obstacle coordinates (X_i, Y_i). Initialize a grid representation or a suitable data structure to store the positions of obstacles for efficient access. Implement a method to simulate Takahashi's movement in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until he hits an obstacle, ensuring to stop at the square right before the obstacle. Create a queue or stack to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) from the starting position (s_x, s_y) to explore all possible moves. Track the number of moves taken to reach each position and ensure that positions are not revisited to avoid infinite loops. Check if the goal position (g_x, g_y) is reached during the search and record the minimum number of moves required. Handle cases where it is impossible to reach the goal position by returning a specific indicator (e.g., -1 or 'impossible'). Ensure that all constraints are respected, including the boundaries of the grid and the positions of obstacles. Format the output to display the minimum number of moves or the impossibility message as specified.
