# Takahashi Movement Simulation

A Python application to simulate Takahashi's movement on a grid while navigating around obstacles to find the minimum number of moves to reach a goal position.

## Main Functions

- **min_moves(s_x, s_y, g_x, g_y, obstacles)**: This function calculates the minimum number of moves required for Takahashi to reach the goal position from the starting position while avoiding obstacles. It implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore possible moves in all four directions (up, down, left, right).

## Quick Install

To run the Takahashi Movement Simulation, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Takahashi Movement Simulation allows users to input a grid size, starting position, goal position, and a list of obstacles. The application will then determine the minimum number of moves Takahashi needs to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles. If the goal is unreachable, the application will return an indicator of impossibility.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**: You will be prompted to enter the following parameters:
   - **Grid Height (H)**: The vertical size of the grid.
   - **Grid Width (W)**: The horizontal size of the grid.
   - **Number of Obstacles (N)**: The total number of obstacles on the grid.
   - **Starting Position (s_x, s_y)**: The coordinates of Takahashi's starting position.
   - **Goal Position (g_x, g_y)**: The coordinates of the goal position.
   - **Obstacles**: A list of obstacle coordinates in the format `X1 Y1, X2 Y2, ...`.

3. **Validation**: The application will validate the input to ensure that:
   - The starting and goal positions are within the grid boundaries.
   - The starting and goal positions are not obstacles.
   - The correct number of obstacle coordinates is provided.

4. **Output**: After processing the input, the application will output the minimum number of moves required to reach the goal position or indicate if it is impossible to reach the goal.

## Example Input

```
Enter grid height (H), width (W), and number of obstacles (N): 5 5 3
Enter Start (s_x, s_y): 1 1
Enter Goal (g_x, g_y): 5 5
Enter obstacles (X1 Y1, X2 Y2, ...): 2 2, 3 3, 4 4
```

## Example Output

```
Minimum Moves: 7
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input issues, such as:
- Out-of-bounds starting or goal positions.
- Invalid obstacle coordinates.
- Mismatched number of obstacles.

If an error occurs, a descriptive message will be displayed to guide the user in correcting their input.

## Conclusion

The Takahashi Movement Simulation provides a simple yet effective way to explore grid navigation problems with obstacles. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and run the simulation to find the minimum moves required for Takahashi to reach his goal.
