Read the positive integer \( N \) from standard input. Initialize a variable \( k = 0 \) to keep track of the maximum integer. Use a loop to find the largest \( k \) such that \( 2^k \leq N \):\n   - Start with \( k = 0 \) and compute \( 2^k \).\n   - Increment \( k \) until \( 2^k \) exceeds \( N \). Once the loop ends, decrement \( k \) by 1 to get the maximum valid \( k \). Print the value of \( k \).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum \( k \) without exceeding the constraints provided.
