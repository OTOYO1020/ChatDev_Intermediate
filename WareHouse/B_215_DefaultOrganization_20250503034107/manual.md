Here's a detailed user manual for the Power of Two application, formatted in Markdown as requested:

```markdown
# Power of Two Application

This application calculates the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 2^k \leq N \), where \( N \) is a positive integer input by the user.

## Quick Install

To run the Power of Two application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can run the application directly without any additional dependencies.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Power of Two application is designed to help users quickly find the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 2^k \) does not exceed a given positive integer \( N \). This can be useful in various mathematical computations and programming scenarios.

## ðŸ“– How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input a Positive Integer**:
   - The application will prompt you to enter a positive integer greater than zero.
   - Type your integer and press Enter.

3. **View the Result**:
   - The application will calculate and display the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 2^k \leq N \).
   - If the input is invalid (not a positive integer), the application will prompt you to try again.

## Example Usage

- **Input**: 
  ```
  Enter a positive integer greater than zero (N): 10
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  The largest integer k such that 2^k <= N is: 3
  ```

In this example, \( 2^3 = 8 \) is the largest power of two that does not exceed 10.

## Error Handling

If you enter a non-positive integer or a non-integer value, the application will display an error message and prompt you to enter a valid positive integer again.

### Example of Error Handling

- **Input**: 
  ```
  Enter a positive integer greater than zero (N): -5
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  Input Error: N must be a positive integer. Please try again.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Power of Two application is a simple yet effective tool for calculating powers of two. It provides a user-friendly interface and handles input errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.
