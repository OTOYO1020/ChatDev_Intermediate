Task:
Read integers N, M, and K from standard input. Read the integer sequence A of length N from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'results' to store the sums for each valid i. Loop through each index i from 1 to N - M + 1:\n   - Extract the subarray 'subarray = A[i-1:i-1+M]' (using zero-based indexing).\n   - Sort the 'subarray' in ascending order.\n   - Calculate the sum of the first K elements in the sorted 'subarray' and store it in 'results'. Print each value in 'results' on a new line.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to be used: 'sum_of_first_k(sorted_subarray, K)'\n- Variables: 'N', 'M', 'K', 'A', 'subarray', 'results'
