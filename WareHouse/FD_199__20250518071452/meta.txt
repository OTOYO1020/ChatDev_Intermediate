Task:
Parse the input to extract the values of N, M, K, the list of edges (X_i, Y_i), and the initial values A_i for each vertex. Initialize a data structure to represent the graph using the edges provided, ensuring it is undirected. Implement a function 'perform_operations(N, M, K, edges, A)' that simulates the K operations on the graph. In 'perform_operations', randomly select an edge from the graph M times, and calculate the arithmetic mean of the values on the connected vertices. Update the values of the two vertices connected by the selected edge with the calculated mean. Repeat the above operation K times to simulate the random selection and updating process. After K operations, calculate the expected value for each vertex based on the final values. Represent the expected value of each vertex as a fraction y/x, ensuring x is not divisible by (10^9 + 7). Compute the integer z such that xz â‰¡ y (mod 10^9 + 7) for each vertex's expected value. Output the results for each vertex as specified, ensuring the values are in the range [0, 10^9 + 6].
