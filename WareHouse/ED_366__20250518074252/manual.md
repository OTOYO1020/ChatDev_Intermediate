# Integer Pairs Counting Application

This application is designed to count the number of integer pairs (x, y) within a specified range that meet a given Manhattan distance threshold from a set of unique points. 

## Main Functions

- **count_integer_pairs(N: int, D: int, points: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int**: This function encapsulates the logic for counting integer pairs based on the Manhattan distance. It takes the number of points (N), the distance threshold (D), and a list of unique points as input, and returns the count of valid pairs.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Run the Application

To start the application, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Input Data

When prompted, enter the following:

1. **Number of Points (N)**: The total number of unique points you want to input.
2. **Distance Threshold (D)**: The maximum allowable Manhattan distance for the pairs to be counted.
3. **Enter Points**: Provide at least N unique points in the format `x,y`, separated by commas. For example:
   ```
   1,2, 3,4, 5,6
   ```

### Step 3: View Results

After entering the data, the application will process the input and display the number of valid pairs that meet the distance criteria.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Number of Points (N): 3
Distance Threshold (D): 5
Please enter at least 3 unique points in the format 'x,y' separated by commas.
Enter Points (x,y) separated by commas: 1,2, 3,4, 5,6
Number of unique points provided: 3
Valid pairs: 12
```

## Error Handling

If you enter invalid data or insufficient unique points, the application will provide an error message indicating what went wrong. Ensure that you follow the input format strictly to avoid errors.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to count integer pairs based on Manhattan distances from a set of points. Feel free to modify the code for additional features or improvements as needed.
