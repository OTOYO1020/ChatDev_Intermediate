**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**‚ùì Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**ü§ñ Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

   ```

4. Once the installation is complete, you can start using the Phrase Matching Software.

### Usage

To use the Phrase Matching Software, follow these steps:

1. Open the main.py file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

2. Modify the values of the `song_notes` and `phrase_sounds` variables to match your input data. The `song_notes` variable should contain the sequence of notes in the song, and the `phrase_sounds` variable should contain the sequence of sounds in the phrase you want to match.

3. Save the changes to the main.py file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located.

5. Run the following command to execute the software:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

6. The software will display the number of occurrences of the phrase in the song.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the Phrase Matching Software:

1. Open the main.py file.

2. Modify the values of the `song_notes` and `phrase_sounds` variables as follows:

   ```
   song_notes = "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
   phrase_sounds = "3 4 5"
   ```

3. Save the changes to the main.py file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located.

5. Run the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

6. The software will display the following output:

   ```
   Number of occurrences: 1
   ```

   This means that the phrase "3 4 5" occurs once in the sequence of notes "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".
