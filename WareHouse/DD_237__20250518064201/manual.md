# Final Sequence Generator

A simple application to generate a sequence based on user-defined rules using the characters 'L' and 'R'.

## Overview

The Final Sequence Generator allows users to input an integer `N` and a string `S` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. The application generates a list starting with `0`, where the subsequent numbers are added to the front or the end of the list based on the characters in the string `S`. 

- **'L'**: Insert the number at the beginning of the list.
- **'R'**: Append the number to the end of the list.

## Quick Install

To run the Final Sequence Generator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can run the application without additional dependencies as it only uses built-in Python libraries.*

## Main Functions

### `final_sequence(N, S)`

- **Parameters**:
  - `N` (int): The number of elements to process.
  - `S` (str): A string consisting of 'L' and 'R' indicating the direction for each element.
  
- **Returns**: 
  - A list containing the final sequence starting with `0`.

### Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- `N` must be a positive integer.
- `S` cannot be empty when `N` is greater than `0`.
- The length of `S` must be equal to `N`.
- `S` must only contain the characters 'L' and 'R'.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: 
   Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**:
   - When prompted, enter a positive integer for `N`.
   - Enter a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

3. **View Results**:
   - The application will output the final list generated based on your inputs.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter N: 5
Enter S (string of L and R): LRLLR
Result: [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 0]
```

In this example, the sequence starts with `0`, and based on the string `S`, the numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` are added to the list according to the specified rules.

## Conclusion

The Final Sequence Generator is a straightforward application designed to help users generate sequences based on simple rules. For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the code comments or reach out for support.
