Task:
Define a function named 'final_sequence' that takes an integer 'N' and a string 'S' as parameters. Initialize a list 'A' with a single element '0'. Iterate over the range from '1' to 'N' (inclusive) using a loop variable 'i'. Within the loop, check the character 's_i' in the string 'S'. If 's_i' is 'L', insert 'i' at the index '0' of the list 'A'. If 's_i' is 'R', append 'i' to the end of the list 'A'. After the loop, return the final list 'A'. Ensure that the function handles the input format correctly, reading 'N' and 'S' from standard input. Implement error handling for invalid input values of 'N' and 'S'. Output the final contents of 'A' in the required format.
