Task:
Receive the input string 'S' from standard input. Initialize counters for 'count_A', 'count_B', and 'count_C' to zero. Traverse through each character in the string 'S':\n   - Increment 'count_A' for each 'A'.\n   - Increment 'count_B' for each 'B'.\n   - Increment 'count_C' for each 'C'. Check if 'count_A', 'count_B', and 'count_C' are greater than or equal to zero. Determine the structure of the string 'S':\n   - If 'count_A > 0', check if the string starts with 'A' and ends with 'C' after the last 'B'.\n   - If 'count_B > 0', ensure that all 'B's are between the last 'A' and the first 'C'. If the conditions for an Extended ABC string are met, set a flag 'is_extended_abc' to true. Print 'Yes' if 'is_extended_abc' is true; otherwise, print 'No'.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to be called: 'is_extended_abc_string(S)'\n- Variables: 'count_A', 'count_B', 'count_C', 'is_extended_abc'. \n\n### Input and Output Format:\n- Input: A string 'S' consisting of characters 'A', 'B', and 'C'.\n- Output: 'Yes' if 'S' is an Extended ABC string; otherwise, 'No'.
