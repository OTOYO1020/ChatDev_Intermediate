Read integers K and N from standard input. Initialize a result array 'ways' of size K+1 to store the number of arrangements for each move count. Calculate the total number of arrangements of N balls (K blue and N-K red) using combinatorial methods. For each possible number of moves 'i' from 1 to K:\n   - Determine the number of ways to arrange the blue balls such that exactly 'i' moves are needed.\n   - This involves placing 'i' separators among the blue balls and ensuring that there are at least one blue ball in each segment. Use dynamic programming or combinatorial counting to compute the valid arrangements for each 'i'. Store the computed values in the 'ways' array. Apply modulo operation with \(10^9 + 7\) to each value in the 'ways' array. Print the values in the 'ways' array from index 1 to K as the final output.
