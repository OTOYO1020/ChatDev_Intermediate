Task:
Define the function signature as 'def max_visible_sevens(N: int, coordinates: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:' to accept the number of 7's and their coordinates. Parse the input to extract the integer N and a list of tuples containing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) for each 7. Implement a data structure to store the coordinates of the 7's for efficient access and manipulation. For each 7, determine its visibility from the origin by checking if the quadrilateral formed by the origin and the 7's coordinates intersects with any other 7's. Create a function 'is_visible(origin: Tuple[int, int], point1: Tuple[int, int], point2: Tuple[int, int], point3: Tuple[int, int]) -> bool' to check if the quadrilateral intersects with any other 7's. Iterate through all combinations of 7's to find the optimal set that maximizes the number of visible 7's after deletions. Keep track of the maximum count of visible 7's during the iteration process. Handle edge cases such as when N is 0 or when all 7's are positioned in a way that they are all visible. Return the maximum count of visible 7's from the function. Ensure the output format is an integer representing the maximum number of visible 7's.
