Define a function 'process_queries(N: int, Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int, int]])' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of toy train cars and Q is the number of queries. Initialize a data structure (e.g., a list or a dictionary) to represent the connections between the toy train cars. Implement the logic to process query type '1 x y' which connects Car y to Car x by updating the data structure accordingly. Implement the logic to process query type '2 x y' which disconnects Car y from Car x by updating the data structure accordingly. Implement the logic to process query type '3 x' which retrieves and prints the car numbers of the connected component containing Car x in the correct order. Ensure that the function handles the input format correctly, reading from standard input or a provided list of queries. Implement error handling to ensure that all queries conform to the constraints provided in the problem statement. Optimize the data structure and query processing to ensure that the solution runs efficiently within the given constraints (up to 10^5 queries). Write unit tests to validate the functionality of each query type and the overall process_queries function. Define the output format for the results of query type '3 x' to ensure it matches the expected output format.
