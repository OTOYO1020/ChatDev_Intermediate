# Good Sequences Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of good sequences based on user-defined pairs of integers and a maximum integer.

## Main Functions

The Good Sequences Calculator provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Maximum Integer (M)**: Users can specify the maximum integer that defines the length of sequences.
- **Input Pairs**: Users can input pairs of integers in the form of tuples, which will be used to determine valid sequences.
- **Calculate Good Sequences**: The application calculates and displays the count of good sequences for each length from 1 to M based on the provided pairs.

## Installation

To run the Good Sequences Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You will need the following Python packages:

- `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- `typing`: For type hinting in function definitions.

You can install the required packages using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install tkinter
```

Note: `tkinter` is included with standard Python installations, so you may not need to install it separately.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: 
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
   - Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Maximum Integer (M)**:
   - In the application window, enter the maximum integer (M) in the designated input field.

3. **Input Pairs**:
   - Enter the pairs of integers in the format `(A_i, B_i)`, separated by commas. For example: `((1, 2), (3, 4))`.

4. **Calculate Good Sequences**:
   - Click the "Calculate" button to compute the good sequences based on your inputs.

5. **View Results**:
   - The results will be displayed in the text area below the input fields. It will show a list of integers corresponding to the counts of good sequences for each length from 1 to M.

## Example Usage

- **Input**:
  - Maximum Integer (M): `4`
  - Pairs: `((1, 2), (2, 3))`
  
- **Output**:
  - The application will display the counts of good sequences for lengths 1 to 4 based on the provided pairs.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors while using the application, ensure that:
- You have entered the maximum integer as a valid integer.
- The pairs are formatted correctly as tuples.
- All required dependencies are installed.

If you continue to experience issues, please check the console for error messages or reach out for support.

## Conclusion

The Good Sequences Calculator is a user-friendly tool designed to help you explore the concept of good sequences based on integer pairs. With its simple interface and straightforward functionality, you can easily calculate and visualize the results for various inputs.
