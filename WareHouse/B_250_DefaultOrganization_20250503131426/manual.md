# Grid Generation Application

A Python application for generating a grid based on specified parameters, allowing users to visualize a checkerboard pattern with customizable tile sizes.

## Main Functions

- **Grid Generation**: The application reads integers N, A, and B from standard input to create a grid of size (A * N) x (B * N).
- **Tile Coloring**: The grid is filled with alternating colors (black and white) based on the position of each tile.
- **Display**: The generated grid is printed in a formatted manner, making it easy to visualize the checkerboard pattern.

## Installation

To run the Grid Generation Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have any external dependencies, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the application files, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**: When prompted, enter the values for N, A, and B. 
   - **N**: The number of tiles in each dimension (e.g., 4 for a 4x4 grid).
   - **A**: The height of each tile (e.g., 2 for a tile that is 2 rows high).
   - **B**: The width of each tile (e.g., 3 for a tile that is 3 columns wide).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter N: 4
   Enter A: 2
   Enter B: 3
   ```

3. **View the Output**: After entering the parameters, the application will generate and display the grid in the terminal. Each tile will be represented by 'B' for black and 'W' for white, creating a checkerboard pattern.

## Example

For example, if you input:
```
Enter N: 2
Enter A: 2
Enter B: 2
```

The output will be:
```
B B W W
B B W W
W W B B
W W B B
```

## Conclusion

The Grid Generation Application provides a simple yet effective way to visualize a checkerboard pattern with customizable tile sizes. Feel free to modify the code to enhance functionality or adapt it to your specific needs.
