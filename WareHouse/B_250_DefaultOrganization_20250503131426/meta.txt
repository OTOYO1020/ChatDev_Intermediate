Task:
Read integers N, A, and B from standard input. Initialize a 2D list 'grid' of size (A * N) x (B * N) to represent the overall grid. Loop through each tile position (i, j) where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N:\n   - Determine the color of the tile based on its position:\n     - If (i + j) is even, set the tile color to white; otherwise, set it to black. For each tile (i, j), fill the corresponding A x B section in 'grid' with the determined color:\n   - Loop through each row 'r' in the tile and each column 'c' in the tile.\n   - Assign the color to 'grid[(i-1)*A + r][(j-1)*B + c]'. Print the grid 'X' in the specified format, ensuring each row is printed correctly.\n\nThis breakdown captures the essential steps to implement the solution based on the problem statement.
