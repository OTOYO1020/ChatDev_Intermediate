Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of elements in the sequence. Read the sequence of integers A from standard input, ensuring it contains exactly N integers. Initialize a boolean array 'seen' of size N+1 to track the presence of integers from 1 to N. Iterate through each integer in the sequence A:\n   - For each integer A[i], check if it is within the range [1, N].\n   - If it is, mark 'seen[A[i]]' as True.\n   - If A[i] is out of range or has been seen before, return False immediately. After processing all integers, check if all values from 1 to N are marked as True in the 'seen' array. If all values are True, return True indicating A is a permutation; otherwise, return False. Print 'YES' if A is a permutation of (1, 2, ..., N); otherwise, print 'NO'.
