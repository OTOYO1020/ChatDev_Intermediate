# Permutation Checker

A simple application to check if a given sequence of integers is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N.

## Main Functions

The Permutation Checker provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer N and a sequence of integers A from standard input.
- **Permutation Check**: Validates if the sequence A is a permutation of the integers from 1 to N.
- **Output**: Prints "YES" if A is a valid permutation; otherwise, prints "NO".

## Installation

To run the Permutation Checker, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the `main.py` and `utils.py` files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**:
   - First, enter an integer N, which represents the number of elements in the sequence.
   - On the next line, enter the sequence of integers separated by spaces.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   3 1 2 5 4
   ```

4. **Output**: After entering the input, the application will process the data and print either "YES" or "NO" based on whether the sequence is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   YES
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the input for N is not a valid integer, it will print an error message.
- If the number of integers provided does not match N, it will notify the user.
- If any input is not a valid integer, it will indicate which input is erroneous.

## Conclusion

The Permutation Checker is a straightforward utility for validating sequences against the criteria of being a permutation. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy to integrate into larger applications or use as a standalone tool.
