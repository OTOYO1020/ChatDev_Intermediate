Define the function 'minimum_cost_to_determine_cards(N: int, M: int, conditions: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int' to handle the input parameters, where 'N' is the number of cards, 'M' is the number of conditions, and 'conditions' is a list of tuples containing '(X_i, Y_i, Z_i).' Parse the input to extract the values of 'N', 'M', and the list of conditions from the input format. Initialize a list 'A' of size 'N' to store the values of the cards, initially set to 'None'. Iterate through the list of conditions to determine the parity (even or odd) of the sums 'A[X_i] + A[Y_i] + Z_i' and store this information. Use a greedy approach to minimize the number of magic uses by determining the values of 'A' based on the established parity conditions. Implement a function to check if the current configuration of 'A' satisfies all the conditions given in the input. Count the number of magic uses required to determine all values in 'A' based on the established conditions. Return the minimum cost calculated from the number of magic uses as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when 'N' or 'M' are at their minimum or maximum limits. Output the result in the format of a single integer representing the minimum cost required.
