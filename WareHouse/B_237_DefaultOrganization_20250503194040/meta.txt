Task:
Read integers H and W from standard input, representing the dimensions of the matrix A. Initialize a 2D list 'A' of size H x W to store the matrix elements. Populate the matrix 'A' by reading H lines of input, each containing W integers. Initialize a 2D list 'B' of size W x H to store the transposed matrix. Loop through each element of matrix 'A' using indices (i, j) and assign 'B[j][i] = A[i][j]' to perform the transposition. Prepare to print the transposed matrix 'B'. Loop through each row of matrix 'B' and print the elements in the required format.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output will be the transposed matrix B, printed row by row, with elements separated by spaces.
