# Matrix Transposition Application

This application allows users to input a matrix of integers and outputs its transposed version. The transposition of a matrix involves flipping it over its diagonal, turning the row indices into column indices and vice versa.

## Main Functions

- **Input Matrix Dimensions**: Users can specify the number of rows (H) and columns (W) for the matrix.
- **Populate Matrix**: Users can enter the elements of the matrix row by row.
- **Transpose Matrix**: The application computes the transposed matrix based on the input.
- **Display Transposed Matrix**: The transposed matrix is printed in a user-friendly format.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries, so you can run it with the standard Python installation.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Matrix Dimensions**:
   You will be prompted to enter the number of rows (H) and columns (W) of the matrix. Ensure that both values are positive integers. For example:
   ```
   Enter the number of rows (H) and columns (W) of the matrix, separated by a space: 3 2
   ```

3. **Populate the Matrix**:
   After specifying the dimensions, you will be prompted to enter the elements for each row of the matrix. Ensure that you provide the correct number of integers for each row. For example:
   ```
   Please enter the integers for row 1, separated by spaces: 1 2
   Please enter the integers for row 2, separated by spaces: 3 4
   Please enter the integers for row 3, separated by spaces: 5 6
   ```

4. **View the Transposed Matrix**:
   Once you have entered all the rows, the application will compute the transposed matrix and display it. The output will look like this:
   ```
   1 3 5
   2 4 6
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to use the application:

```
Enter the number of rows (H) and columns (W) of the matrix, separated by a space: 2 3
Please enter the integers for row 1, separated by spaces: 1 2 3
Please enter the integers for row 2, separated by spaces: 4 5 6
```

Output:
```
1 4
2 5
3 6
```

## Conclusion

This Matrix Transposition Application is a simple yet powerful tool for manipulating matrices. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for educational purposes or basic matrix operations. For any issues or feedback, please contact the development team.
