# Dog Name Generator

Generate unique dog names based on a given integer input.

## Introduction

The Dog Name Generator is a Python application that generates unique names for dogs based on an integer input \(N\). The names are generated using a base-26 representation, where each name corresponds to a specific integer value. This application is designed to be simple and user-friendly, allowing users to easily generate names for their pets.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input integer \(N\) falls within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 1000000000000001\).
- **Name Generation**: Calculates the cumulative count of names for each length until the cumulative count exceeds \(N\), then generates the corresponding dog name.
- **Index to Name Conversion**: Converts the calculated index into a string of characters using 'a' to 'z'.

## Installation

To run the Dog Name Generator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Dog Name Generator repository from GitHub (or download the files directly).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-name-generator.git
   cd dog-name-generator
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install any required dependencies using pip. The application does not have external dependencies, but ensure you have the latest version of Python.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: If there is no `requirements.txt`, you can skip this step.)*

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the application files are located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input an Integer**: When prompted, enter an integer \(N\) within the specified range (1 to 1000000000000001).

   ```
   Enter a number (1 to 1000000000000001): 5
   ```

3. **Receive the Dog Name**: After entering the number, the application will generate and display the corresponding dog name.

   ```
   Dog Name: e
   ```

## Example Usage

- **Input**: `1`
- **Output**: `a`

- **Input**: `27`
- **Output**: `aa`

## Error Handling

- If the input is not a valid integer, the application will prompt the user to enter a valid integer.
- If the input integer is out of the specified range, an error message will be displayed.
