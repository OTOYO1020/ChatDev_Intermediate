Task:
Receive the integer N from standard input, ensuring it falls within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 1000000000000001\). Initialize a variable 'name' to store the resulting dog name. Determine the length of the name based on the value of N:\n   - Calculate the cumulative count of names for each length until the cumulative count exceeds N. Calculate the index of the name within its length category:\n   - Use the formula to find the index relative to the starting point of that length category. Generate the name using a base-26 representation:\n   - Convert the index to a string of characters using 'a' to 'z' for digits 0 to 25. Handle the conversion from index to name:\n   - Implement a function 'index_to_name(index)' that converts the index to the corresponding name. Print the resulting name for the dog numbered N.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output will be a single string representing the name of the dog numbered N.
