# Sequence Equality Checker

A simple application to determine if two sequences of integers can be rearranged to match each other.

## Main Functions

The Sequence Equality Checker provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads two sequences of integers from standard input.
- **Length Validation**: Ensures that both sequences have the same length.
- **Element Counting**: Counts the occurrences of each integer in both sequences.
- **Comparison**: Checks if the counts of each integer in both sequences are the same.
- **Output**: Returns 'Yes' if the sequences can be made equal, otherwise returns 'No'.

## Quick Install

To run the Sequence Equality Checker, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Sequence Equality Checker is designed to help users determine if two lists of integers can be rearranged to form the same sequence. This is particularly useful in various applications where data integrity and comparison are essential.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Save the provided code into two files: `main.py` and `utils.py`.

2. **Input Format**:
   - When prompted, enter the sequences as comma-separated integers without spaces. For example:
     ```
     Enter Sequence A (comma-separated integers, no spaces): 1,2,3
     Enter Sequence B (comma-separated integers, no spaces): 3,2,1
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - The application will print 'Yes' if the sequences can be made equal, or 'No' if they cannot.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The application handles edge cases, such as empty sequences or sequences of different lengths, by providing appropriate error messages.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter Sequence A (comma-separated integers, no spaces): 1,2,3
Enter Sequence B (comma-separated integers, no spaces): 3,2,1
Yes

$ python main.py
Enter Sequence A (comma-separated integers, no spaces): 1,2,2
Enter Sequence B (comma-separated integers, no spaces): 2,1,1
No
```

## Testing

The application has been tested with various test cases to ensure correctness and efficiency, even with sequences of up to 200,000 elements.

## Conclusion

The Sequence Equality Checker is a straightforward yet powerful tool for comparing sequences of integers. By following the instructions above, users can easily determine if two sequences can be rearranged to match each other.
