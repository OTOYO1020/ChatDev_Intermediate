Task:
Define the function 'can_make_equal(A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> str' to check if sequences A and B can be made equal. Implement input handling to read two sequences of integers A and B from standard input. Ensure that the lengths of sequences A and B are equal and equal to N. Check if the elements of A and B can be rearranged to match each other by counting the occurrences of each integer in both sequences. Implement the logic to determine if the counts of each integer in A and B are the same. If the counts match, return 'Yes'; otherwise, return 'No'. Handle edge cases where N is at its minimum or maximum limits. Optimize the solution to ensure it runs efficiently within the constraints (up to 200,000 elements). Test the function with various test cases to ensure correctness. Format the output to print 'Yes' or 'No' based on the result of the function.
