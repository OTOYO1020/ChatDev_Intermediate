# Voting System

A simple application to determine winners based on votes for candidates.

## Overview

The Voting System allows users to input the number of candidates and their respective votes. The system processes the votes and determines the current winner after each vote is counted. In case of a tie, the candidate with the smallest candidate number is selected as the winner.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of candidates and their votes from the user.
- **Vote Counting**: It maintains a count of votes for each candidate.
- **Winner Determination**: After each vote, it determines the current winner based on the highest vote count, handling ties appropriately.
- **Output**: The application outputs the current winner after each vote.

## Installation

To run the Voting System, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   The Voting System requires no external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Simply ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the number of candidates**:
   When prompted, enter the number of candidates (N). This should be a positive integer.

3. **Input the votes**:
   Enter the votes as a comma-separated list of integers. Each integer should correspond to the candidate number (1 to N). For example:
   ```
   Enter votes (comma-separated): 1,2,1,3,2,1
   ```

4. **View the results**:
   After entering the votes, the application will display the current winner after each vote. For example:
   ```
   Winners after each valid vote:
   1
   1
   1
   3
   2
   1
   ```

## Edge Cases

- If no votes are provided, the application will return an empty list of winners.
- Invalid votes (votes for candidates outside the range of 1 to N) will be ignored, and a warning will be displayed.
