Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input. Read the array of integers A containing N elements. Sort the array A in descending order to prioritize larger values for product calculation. Initialize a variable 'max_product' to 1 to store the maximum product. Loop through the first K elements of the sorted array A:\n   - Multiply 'max_product' by each of these K elements. Handle the case where the product might be negative:\n   - If the count of negative numbers in the chosen K elements is odd, consider the next largest negative number (if available) to maximize the product. Compute 'max_product' modulo (10^9 + 7) to ensure it fits within the required output constraints. Print the final value of 'max_product'.
