# Convexity Checker

A simple application to determine if a quadrilateral formed by four vertices is convex.

## Main Functions

The Convexity Checker allows users to input the coordinates of four vertices and checks if the quadrilateral formed by these vertices is convex. The main functions include:

- **Input Handling**: Accepts user input for the coordinates of the vertices in a specified format.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the input coordinates are integers within the range of -10,000 to 10,000.
- **Convexity Check**: Computes the cross products of the vectors formed by the edges of the quadrilateral to determine if it is convex.
- **Output**: Returns 'YES' if the quadrilateral is convex and 'NO' otherwise.

## Installation

To run the Convexity Checker, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the code:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have external dependencies beyond the standard library, so no additional installations are required.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Coordinates**: When prompted, enter the coordinates of the four vertices in the following format:
   ```
   Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy, Dx, Dy
   ```
   For example:
   ```
   0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the coordinates, the application will process the input and display whether the quadrilateral is convex:
   ```
   YES
   ```
   or
   ```
   NO
   ```

4. **Error Handling**: If the input is invalid (e.g., not integers, out of range, or incorrect format), the application will provide an error message and prompt you to enter the coordinates again.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the coordinates:
   ```
   Enter coordinates as Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy, Dx, Dy (comma-separated): 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   YES
   ```

## Conclusion

The Convexity Checker is a straightforward tool for determining the convexity of a quadrilateral based on user-provided vertex coordinates. With its simple interface and robust validation, it ensures accurate results while guiding users through the input process.
