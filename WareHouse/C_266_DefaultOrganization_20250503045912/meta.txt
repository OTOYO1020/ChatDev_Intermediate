Task:
Read the coordinates of the four vertices \( (A_x, A_y) \), \( (B_x, B_y) \), \( (C_x, C_y) \), and \( (D_x, D_y) \) from standard input. Store the vertices in a list or tuple as 'vertices = [(A_x, A_y), (B_x, B_y), (C_x, C_y), (D_x, D_y)]'. Define a function 'is_convex(vertices)' that takes the list of vertices as an argument. In 'is_convex', compute the cross product of the vectors formed by consecutive edges:\n   - Calculate vectors \( AB = (B_x - A_x, B_y - A_y) \), \( BC = (C_x - B_x, C_y - B_y) \), \( CD = (D_x - C_x, D_y - C_y) \), and \( DA = (A_x - D_x, A_y - D_y) \).\n   - Compute the cross products: \n     - \( cross1 = AB_x \cdot BC_y - AB_y \cdot BC_x \)\n     - \( cross2 = BC_x \cdot CD_y - BC_y \cdot CD_x \)\n     - \( cross3 = CD_x \cdot DA_y - CD_y \cdot DA_x \)\n     - \( cross4 = DA_x \cdot AB_y - DA_y \cdot AB_x \) Check the signs of the cross products:\n   - If all cross products are positive or all are negative, the quadrilateral is convex.\n   - Otherwise, it is not convex. Return 'YES' if the quadrilateral is convex, otherwise return 'NO'. Call the function 'is_convex(vertices)' and store the result. Print the result ('YES' or 'NO') based on the output of the function. Ensure that the input values are within the specified range and are integers. Handle any potential errors in input format or value constraints gracefully.
