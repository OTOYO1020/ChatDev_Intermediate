Define a function 'max_happiness(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to calculate the maximum total happiness points. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the list A of activeness values for the children. Implement a method to generate all possible permutations of the list A to explore different arrangements of children. For each permutation, calculate the total happiness points based on the formula A[x] * |x - y| for each child in the new arrangement. Keep track of the maximum happiness points encountered while evaluating all permutations. Optimize the calculation to avoid redundant evaluations, possibly by using sorting or dynamic programming. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as minimum and maximum values of N and A_i. Test the function with various test cases to validate correctness and performance. Document the function with appropriate comments explaining the logic and complexity. Return the maximum happiness points as the output of the function.
