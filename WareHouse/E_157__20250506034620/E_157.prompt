Read the integers N (length of string S) and Q (number of queries) from standard input. Read the string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. Initialize a data structure (e.g., a set or a frequency array) to efficiently track the unique characters in S. For each query from 1 to Q:\n   - Read the query type (1 or 2).\n   - If the query type is 1:\n     - Read the integers i_q (position) and c_q (character).\n     - Check if the character at position i_q in S is different from c_q.\n     - If different, update S[i_q] to c_q and update the data structure accordingly.\n   - If the query type is 2:\n     - Read the integers l_q (start position) and r_q (end position).\n     - Extract the substring S[l_q-1:r_q] and determine the number of unique characters in this substring using the data structure. Print the results for all type 2 queries.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that we handle both types of queries efficiently while maintaining the integrity of the string S and the count of unique characters.
