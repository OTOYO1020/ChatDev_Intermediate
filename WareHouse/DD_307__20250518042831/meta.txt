Task:
Define a function named 'remove_contiguous_substrings' that takes a string 'S' as input. Initialize a stack to keep track of the characters in the string 'S'. Iterate through each character in the string 'S' using a loop. For each character, check if it is an opening parenthesis '('; if so, push it onto the stack. If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', check if the top of the stack is an opening parenthesis '('; if so, pop the '(' from the stack. If the character is neither '(' nor ')', push it onto the stack. After processing all characters, convert the stack back into a string, which will represent the modified string after all possible operations. Return the modified string from the function. Handle input by reading the string 'S' and its length 'N' from standard input. Print the output string after calling the function with the input string.
