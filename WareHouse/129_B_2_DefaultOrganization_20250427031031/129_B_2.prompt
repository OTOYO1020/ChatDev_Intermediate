Input Handling: Read integer 'N' and array 'W' of size 'N' from standard input. Ensure that 'W' contains the masses of the weights indexed from 1 to 'N'. Initialize Variables: Create a variable 'min_difference' and set it to a large number (e.g., infinity) to keep track of the minimum absolute difference between 'S_1' and 'S_2'. Iterate Over Possible Divisions: Loop over each possible division point 'T' from 1 to 'N-1'. Calculate Sums for Each Division: For each 'T', calculate 'S_1' as the sum of the masses of weights with indices from 1 to 'T'. / Calculate 'S_2' as the sum of the masses of weights with indices from 'T+1' to 'N'. Compute Absolute Difference: For each division, compute the absolute difference between 'S_1' and 'S_2'. Update Minimum Difference: If the computed absolute difference is less than 'min_difference', update 'min_difference' with this new value. Output Result: After evaluating all possible divisions, print the 'min_difference', which represents the minimum possible absolute difference between 'S_1' and 'S_2'.
