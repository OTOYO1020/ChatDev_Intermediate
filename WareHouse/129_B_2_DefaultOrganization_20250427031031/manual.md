# Weight Difference Calculator

The Weight Difference Calculator is a Python application designed to compute the minimum absolute difference between two sums of weights based on user input. This tool is useful for scenarios where you need to balance weights or minimize discrepancies between two groups.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the number of weights and the weights themselves, ensuring that all weights are positive integers.
- **Calculation**: It calculates the minimum absolute difference between the sums of two groups of weights based on various division points.
- **Output**: The application displays the minimum difference after evaluating all possible divisions.

## Quick Install

To run the Weight Difference Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: Currently, there are no additional dependencies specified, but this section can be updated if needed in the future.)

## How to Use the Weight Difference Calculator

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Weights**: When prompted, enter the total number of weights you wish to input. For example:

   ```
   Enter the number of weights: 5
   ```

3. **Input the Weights**: Next, enter the weights as positive integers separated by spaces. For example:

   ```
   Enter 5 positive weights (space-separated): 10 20 30 40 50
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After entering the weights, the application will calculate and display the minimum absolute difference between the two sums of weights. For example:

   ```
   Minimum Difference: 10
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how the application works:

1. Start the application.
2. Input the number of weights: `4`.
3. Input the weights: `5 10 15 20`.
4. The application will output the minimum difference.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that all weights entered are positive integers and match the specified count.
- The application currently does not require any external libraries, making it lightweight and easy to run.
