Define a function 'min_operations_to_equalize(A: List[int]) -> int' that takes a list of integers A as input. Implement input handling to read the sequence of integers from standard input, ensuring that the input format matches the constraints. Check if all elements in A can be reduced to the same value by repeatedly dividing by 2 or 3. Create a helper function 'reduce_to_prime_factors(x: int) -> Tuple[int, int]' that returns the count of 2s and 3s in the prime factorization of x. Iterate through each element in A and use 'reduce_to_prime_factors' to count the number of divisions by 2 and 3 for each element. Determine the minimum number of operations required to make all counts of 2s and 3s equal across all elements in A. If it is impossible to equalize the elements, return -1. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when all elements are already equal. Implement output handling to print the result of the function, either the minimum number of operations or -1. Test the function with various test cases to validate correctness and performance within the given constraints.
