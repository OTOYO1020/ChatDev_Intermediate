# Equalizer Application

A Python application designed to equalize a list of integers by repeatedly dividing them by 2 or 3.

## Overview

The Equalizer application provides a function to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all integers in a list equal by reducing them through division by 2 or 3. This application is useful for scenarios where you need to normalize a set of integers based on specific mathematical operations.

## Main Functions

- **min_operations_to_equalize(A: List[int]) -> int**: 
  - Takes a list of integers as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to equalize them, or -1 if it is impossible.
  
- **reduce_to_prime_factors(x: int) -> Tuple[int, int]**: 
  - A helper function that returns the count of 2s and 3s in the prime factorization of a given integer.

## Installation

To run the Equalizer application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If there are no specific dependencies listed, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## Usage

To use the Equalizer application, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your input**: 
   - The application reads a sequence of integers from standard input. Ensure your input is formatted correctly (space-separated integers).

2. **Run the application**:
   - You can run the application from the command line. For example:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Example**:
   - When prompted, enter your list of integers. For example:
   ```
   12 18 24
   ```

4. **Output**:
   - The application will print the minimum number of operations required to equalize the integers or -1 if it is impossible.

## Example Test Cases

Here are some example test cases to validate the correctness of the application:

- **Input**: `12 18 24`
  - **Output**: `3` (Operations: 12 -> 3, 18 -> 3, 24 -> 3)

- **Input**: `8 16 32`
  - **Output**: `3` (Operations: 8 -> 1, 16 -> 1, 32 -> 1)

- **Input**: `5 10 15`
  - **Output**: `-1` (Impossible to equalize)

## Edge Cases

- If the input list is empty, the application will return -1.
- If any integer in the input list is non-positive, the application will return -1.
- If all integers are already equal, the application will return 0.

## Conclusion

The Equalizer application is a simple yet powerful tool for normalizing integers through division. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for various mathematical and computational tasks.
