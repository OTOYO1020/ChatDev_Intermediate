Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of players. Read the array A of length N, containing the scores of each player. Create a list of tuples, pairing each score with its corresponding player index: 'score_with_index = [(A[i], i + 1) for i in range(N)]'. Sort the 'score_with_index' list based on scores in ascending order. Identify the player with the second lowest score by accessing the second element in the sorted list: 'second_lowest_player = score_with_index[1][1]'. Print the player index of the second lowest scorer.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that we handle the input correctly, process the scores to find the required player, and format the output as specified.
