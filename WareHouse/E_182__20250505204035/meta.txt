Task:
Read integers H and W from standard input, representing the dimensions of the grid. Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of bulbs and blocks, respectively. Initialize a grid structure to represent the H x W grid. For each bulb (i from 1 to N):\n   - Read the coordinates (A_i, B_i) from standard input.\n   - Mark the grid at (A_i, B_i) as a bulb. For each block (i from 1 to M):\n   - Read the coordinates (C_i, D_i) from standard input.\n   - Mark the grid at (C_i, D_i) as a block. Initialize a set or a similar structure to keep track of illuminated squares. For each bulb located at (A_i, B_i):\n   - Illuminate squares in the up, down, left, and right directions until a block is encountered or the edge of the grid is reached.\n   - Add each illuminated square to the set of illuminated squares. Count the number of unique illuminated squares that are not blocks. Print the count of illuminated squares.\n\nFunction to handle the illumination process could be named 'illuminate_bulbs(grid, bulbs, blocks)', where 'grid' is the representation of the grid, 'bulbs' is a list of bulb coordinates, and 'blocks' is a list of block coordinates. \n\nOutput format will be the integer count of illuminated squares printed to standard output.
