Task:
Read integers X, K, and D from standard input. Calculate the absolute value of the initial position: 'initial_abs = abs(X)'. Determine the maximum distance Takahashi can move in K moves: 'max_move = K * D'. If 'initial_abs' is less than or equal to 'max_move', calculate the minimum possible absolute value:\n   - If '(max_move - initial_abs) % 2 == 0', the minimum absolute value is '0'.\n   - Otherwise, the minimum absolute value is '1'. If 'initial_abs' is greater than 'max_move', the minimum possible absolute value is 'initial_abs - max_move'. Print the result of the minimum possible absolute value of the destination coordinate.
