# Takahashi Movement Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum possible absolute value of Takahashi's destination coordinate based on his movements.

## Quick Install

To run the Takahashi Movement Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Dependencies

No additional dependencies are required for this application, as it uses only built-in Python libraries.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Takahashi Movement Calculator allows users to input three integers: X (the initial position), K (the number of moves), and D (the distance per move). The application calculates the minimum possible absolute value of the destination coordinate based on the provided inputs.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter three integers separated by spaces. It validates the input to ensure that:
   - Exactly three integers are provided.
   - K and D are non-negative integers.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - Computes the absolute value of the initial position: `initial_abs = abs(X)`.
   - Determines the maximum distance Takahashi can move: `max_move = K * D`.
   - If `initial_abs` is less than or equal to `max_move`, it calculates the minimum possible absolute value based on the parity of `(max_move - initial_abs)`.
   - If `initial_abs` is greater than `max_move`, it calculates the minimum possible absolute value as `initial_abs - max_move`.

3. **Output**: The application prints the result of the minimum possible absolute value of the destination coordinate.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - When prompted, enter three integers separated by spaces. For example:
     ```
     Please enter three integers separated by spaces (X K D, where X can be negative): 5 3 2
     ```

3. **Understanding the Output**:
   - After entering valid inputs, the application will calculate and display the minimum possible absolute value based on the provided logic.

### Example Usage

- Input: `5 3 2`
- Output: `1`

This indicates that the minimum possible absolute value of the destination coordinate is `1`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you enter invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, fewer or more than three integers), the application will prompt you to try again, up to a maximum of 5 attempts.
- If the maximum attempts are reached, the application will exit with a message.

## Conclusion

The Takahashi Movement Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating movement outcomes based on user-defined parameters. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our support team.
