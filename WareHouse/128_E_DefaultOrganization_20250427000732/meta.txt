Task:
Input Handling: Read integers \( N \) and \( Q \) from standard input, followed by \( N \) triplets \((X_i, S_i, T_i)\) and \( Q \) integers \( D_i \). Store these values in appropriate data structures: a list of tuples for roadworks and a list for start times. Data Structure Initialization: Initialize a dictionary 'blocked_intervals' where each key is a coordinate \( X_i \) and the value is a list of tuples representing the blocked time intervals \((S_i, T_i)\). Populate Blocked Intervals: Iterate over the list of roadworks and populate the 'blocked_intervals' dictionary with the corresponding time intervals for each coordinate \( X_i \). Sort Intervals: For each coordinate in 'blocked_intervals', sort the list of intervals by their start time \( S_i \). Merge Intervals: Implement a function 'merge_intervals(intervals)' that merges overlapping or contiguous intervals for each coordinate in 'blocked_intervals'. Simulate Walking: For each person starting at time \( D_i \), call a function 'find_distance(D_i, blocked_intervals)' to determine the distance they can walk before encountering a blocked point. Binary Search for Blocked Point: In 'find_distance', use binary search to efficiently find the first blocked point a person encounters after starting at time \( D_i \). Calculate Distance: For each person, calculate the distance walked as the difference between the starting point (0) and the coordinate of the first blocked point encountered. Store Results: Store the calculated distances for each person in a list 'distances'. Output Results: Print each distance from the 'distances' list on a new line, representing the distance each person walked before stopping.
