Define a function 'count_triples(N: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting the triples. Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to keep track of the number of valid triples (A, B, C). Use a loop to iterate over possible values of A from 1 to the cube root of N, inclusive. For each value of A, use a nested loop to iterate over possible values of B from A to the square root of (N / A), inclusive. For each combination of A and B, calculate the maximum value of C such that C is less than or equal to N / (A * B). Check if the calculated C is greater than or equal to B; if so, add the number of valid C values to 'count'. Return the final value of 'count' after all loops have completed. Handle input by reading the integer N from standard input. Ensure that the function handles the constraints correctly, particularly the upper limit of N. Output the result as an integer, which is the count of valid triples.
