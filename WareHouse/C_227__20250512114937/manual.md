# Count Triples Application

This application is designed to count the number of valid triples (A, B, C) based on specific mathematical conditions. It allows users to input a number \( N \) and calculates the count of valid triples that satisfy the given constraints.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this application is `count_triples(N: int) -> int`, which performs the following:

- Initializes a count of valid triples to zero.
- Iterates over possible values of \( A \) from 1 to the cube root of \( N \).
- For each value of \( A \), iterates over possible values of \( B \) from \( A \) to the square root of \( (N / A) \).
- Calculates the maximum value of \( C \) such that \( C \leq N / (A \times B) \).
- Checks if the calculated \( C \) is greater than or equal to \( B \) and counts the valid values of \( C \).
- Returns the final count of valid triples after all iterations.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. **No additional libraries are required** for this application as it uses built-in Python functionalities.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files (`main.py` and `counting.py`).
2. Navigate to the directory where the files are located.

## How to Use the Application

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
3. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \) (e.g., `100`).
5. The application will output the number of valid triples (A, B, C) that can be formed with the given \( N \).

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter a number N: 100
Number of valid triples: 10
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-integer value or a value less than 1, the application will display an error message indicating that the input must be a positive integer.

```plaintext
Input Error: N must be a positive integer.
```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to count valid triples based on mathematical constraints. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily run the application and obtain results for any positive integer \( N \).
