# Integer List Management Application

A simple application for managing a list of integers through various operations such as adding, removing, and sorting.

## Main Functions

The application supports the following operations:

1. **Add an Integer**: Append an integer to the end of the list.
   - Command: `1 x` (where `x` is the integer to be added)

2. **Remove and Print the First Integer**: Print the first integer in the list and remove it.
   - Command: `2`

3. **Sort the List**: Sort the list of integers in ascending order.
   - Command: `3`

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application uses the `collections` module, which is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installations are required. However, ensure you have Python version 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the application files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Queries**: After running the application, you will be prompted to enter the number of queries (`Q`). Enter an integer value representing how many operations you want to perform.

4. **Enter Commands**: For each query, enter one of the following commands:
   - To add an integer: `1 x` (replace `x` with the integer you want to add)
   - To remove and print the first integer: `2`
   - To sort the list: `3`

5. **View Results**: The application will print the results of all type `2` queries in the order they were processed.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Input:
5
1 10
1 20
2
3
2

Output:
10
20
```

In this example:
- The first query adds `10` to the list.
- The second query adds `20` to the list.
- The third query prints and removes the first element (`10`).
- The fourth query sorts the list (which is now `[20]`).
- The fifth query prints and removes the first element (`20`).

## Error Handling

- If you attempt to perform a type `2` operation when the list is empty, the application will print a message indicating that the operation cannot be performed.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to manage a list of integers through various operations. It is designed to be efficient and user-friendly, making it suitable for basic list management tasks.
