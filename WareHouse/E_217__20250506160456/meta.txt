Task:
Read the integer Q from standard input, which represents the number of queries. Initialize an empty list 'A' to store the sequence. Loop through the range of Q to process each query:\n   - For each query, read the input which can be either of the forms '1 x', '2', or '3'. If the query is of the form '1 x':\n   - Append the integer 'x' to the end of the list 'A'. If the query is of the form '2':\n   - Print the first element of the list 'A'.\n   - Remove the first element from the list 'A'. If the query is of the form '3':\n   - Sort the list 'A' in ascending order. Ensure that the list 'A' is not empty when processing a query of type '2'. Handle all input and output operations efficiently to accommodate the constraints. Use appropriate data structures to ensure that operations on 'A' (append, delete, sort) are performed optimally. Print the results for all type '2' queries in the order they were processed.
