Task:
Define the function 'find_meeting_point(N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> float' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of fuses, A is a list of lengths of the fuses, and B is a list of burn speeds. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the lists A and B from the input format. Initialize two pointers, 'left_position' and 'right_position', to represent the current positions of the flames starting from the left end (0) and the right end (sum of lengths of all fuses). Calculate the time taken for each flame to reach its respective positions by using the formula 'time = distance / speed' for each fuse. Simulate the burning process by iterating through the fuses and updating the positions of the flames based on the burn speeds until they meet. Determine the meeting point by comparing the distances traveled by both flames and adjusting their positions accordingly. Calculate the distance from the left end to the meeting point once the two flames converge. Ensure that the solution handles edge cases, such as when N is 1 or when the fuses have varying lengths and speeds. Return the calculated distance as a float value, ensuring it is formatted to the required precision. Print the output in the specified format after calling the function with the parsed input.
