# Tuple Counter

A simple application to count valid tuples (A, B, C) such that \( A \times B + C = N \).

## Overview

The Tuple Counter application allows users to input a positive integer \( N \) and calculates the number of valid tuples \( (A, B, C) \) that satisfy the equation \( A \times B + C = N \). This application is useful for mathematical explorations and combinatorial problems.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter a positive integer \( N \).
- **Tuple Counting**: It counts all valid tuples \( (A, B, C) \) based on the specified equation.
- **Output**: Displays the total count of valid tuples to the user.

## Installation

To run the Tuple Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. However, ensure you have a working Python environment.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Positive Integer**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \). For example:

   ```
   Enter a positive integer N: 10
   ```

3. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and display the number of valid tuples. For example:

   ```
   Number of valid tuples: 12
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how the application works:

- If you input \( N = 10 \), the application will evaluate all combinations of \( A \) and \( B \) to find valid \( C \) values and return the total count of valid tuples.

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-positive integer, the application will raise an error and prompt you to enter a valid positive integer.

   ```
   Input Error: N must be a positive integer.
   ```

## Conclusion

The Tuple Counter application is a straightforward tool for counting valid mathematical tuples based on user input. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for both educational and exploratory purposes.
