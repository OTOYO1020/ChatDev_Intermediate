Task:
Read the positive integer \( N \) from standard input. Initialize a counter variable 'count' to 0 to keep track of valid tuples. Loop through all possible values of \( A \) from 1 to \( N-1 \):\n   - For each \( A \), loop through all possible values of \( B \) from 1 to \( (N - A) \):\n     - Calculate \( C \) as \( C = N - A \times B \).\n     - Check if \( C \) is a positive integer (i.e., \( C > 0 \)).\n     - If valid, increment 'count' by 1. After completing the loops, print the final value of 'count'.\n\nThis approach ensures that all tuples \( (A, B, C) \) that satisfy the equation \( A \times B + C = N \) are counted correctly.
