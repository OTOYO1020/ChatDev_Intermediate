# GCD Calculation Software

A Python application for calculating the maximum GCD from a sequence of integers.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a sequence of integers and a positive integer K, and it computes the maximum GCD from all possible subsets of size K that include a specified element from the sequence. It is designed to be efficient and user-friendly, providing clear error messages for invalid inputs.

## Main Functions

- **calculate_max_gcd(N, K, A)**: Computes the maximum GCD from the sequence A of length N, considering subsets of size K.
- **gcd_of_list(numbers)**: Utility function that computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `math.gcd` function.
- **Input Handling**: The program prompts the user for input and validates it to ensure correctness.

## Installation

To run the GCD calculation software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the software:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The software requires no external dependencies beyond the Python standard library. However, if you want to ensure you have the latest version of `math` and `functools`, you can run:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade math functools
   ```

## Usage

To use the GCD calculation software, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Values**:
   - When prompted, enter the integer N (the length of the sequence A).
   - Enter the positive integer K (the number of elements in the subset).
   - Input the sequence A as space-separated integers.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter N (length of sequence A): 5
   Enter K (number of elements in subset, must be positive): 3
   Enter sequence A (space-separated integers): 12 15 18 24 30
   ```

3. **View the Result**: After entering the inputs, the program will compute and display the maximum GCD found among the subsets.

   Example output:
   ```
   Maximum GCD: 6
   ```

## Error Handling

The software includes error handling for common input issues:
- If K is greater than N, a ValueError will be raised.
- If K is not a positive integer, a ValueError will be raised.
- If the length of sequence A does not match N, a ValueError will be raised.

## Conclusion

This GCD calculation software is a powerful tool for users needing to compute the maximum GCD from a sequence of integers efficiently. For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact support.
