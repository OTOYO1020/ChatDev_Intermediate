Task:
Read the integer N and the positive integer K from standard input. Read the sequence A of length N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'max_gcd' to store the maximum GCD found. For each index 'i' from 1 to N:\n   - Create a subset 'chosen_elements' that includes 'A[i]' and K-1 other elements from A.\n   - Call a function 'calculate_max_gcd(chosen_elements)' to find the maximum GCD of the chosen elements. In 'calculate_max_gcd(chosen_elements)', compute the GCD of all elements in 'chosen_elements'. Update 'max_gcd' if the GCD found is greater than the current 'max_gcd'. After iterating through all indices, print the value of 'max_gcd'.\n\nNote: The function 'calculate_max_gcd' should efficiently compute the GCD for the chosen elements, considering the constraints on N and A_i.
