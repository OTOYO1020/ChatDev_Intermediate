Read integers N, K, and M from standard input. Read the scores of the first N-1 subjects into an array A of length N-1. Calculate the total score required to achieve the average of M points over N subjects: 'required_total = M * N'. Calculate the current total score from the first N-1 subjects: 'current_total = sum(A)'. Determine the minimum score needed on the final subject: 'needed_score = required_total - current_total'. Check if the 'needed_score' is within the valid range [0, K]:\n   - If 'needed_score < 0', print '-1' (goal is unachievable).\n   - If 'needed_score > K', print '-1' (goal is unachievable).\n   - Otherwise, print 'needed_score' (minimum score needed on the final subject). Ensure all input values are integers and within specified constraints.
