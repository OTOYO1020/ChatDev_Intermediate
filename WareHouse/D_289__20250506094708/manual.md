# Step Reaching Problem Solver

A Python application designed to determine if a robot can reach a specified step using given step sizes while avoiding traps.

## Quick Install

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This application solves the problem of determining whether a robot can reach a specific step (X) by using various step sizes defined in an array (A) while avoiding certain trap positions defined in another array (B). The solution employs a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore possible steps.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application reads integers N (size of array A), M (size of array B), and X (target step) from standard input, followed by the elements of arrays A and B.

2. **Trap Initialization**: The positions of traps are stored in a set for quick lookup, ensuring that the robot does not step on a trap.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The application uses BFS to explore all possible steps the robot can take from the starting position (0) until it either reaches the target step (X) or exhausts all possibilities.

4. **Output**: The application prints "YES" if the robot can reach the target step and "NO" if it cannot.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Input Format**: Provide the input in the following format:
   - First line: Two integers N and M, followed by the integer X.
   - Second line: N integers representing the array A (step sizes).
   - Third line: M integers representing the array B (trap positions).

**Example Input:**
```
3 2 10
1 2 3
4 5
```

3. **Output**: The application will output either "YES" or "NO" based on whether the robot can reach the X-th step.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- Non-integer inputs for N, M, X, A, or B.
- Mismatched sizes of arrays A and B with their respective sizes N and M.
- Negative values for N and M.
