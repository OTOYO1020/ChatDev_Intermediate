Read integers N and M from standard input, followed by the array A of size N and the array B of size M. Initialize a set 'traps' to store the positions of traps from array B for quick lookup. Initialize a queue 'queue' to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the 0-th step. Initialize a set 'visited' to keep track of the steps that have already been visited to avoid cycles. While the 'queue' is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the current step 'current'.\n   - For each step size in array A:\n     - Calculate the next step as 'next_step = current + A[i]'.\n     - If 'next_step' is equal to X, print YES and return.\n     - If 'next_step' is less than X and not in 'traps' and not in 'visited', enqueue 'next_step' and mark it as visited. If the queue is exhausted and X has not been reached, print NO.\n\n### Input Format:\n- The input consists of integers N, M, followed by N integers representing the array A and M integers representing the array B.\n\n### Function Call:\n- The main logic will be implemented in a function 'can_reach_step(N, M, A, B)' which will handle the above steps.\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output will be either YES if the robot can reach the X-th step or NO if it cannot.
