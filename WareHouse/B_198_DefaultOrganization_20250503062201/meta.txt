Task:
Read the integer N from standard input. Convert N to its string representation 'str_N'. Check if 'str_N' is already a palindrome:\n   - If it is, print 'YES' and terminate. If not, create a new string 'padded_str' by adding leading zeros to 'str_N' to form potential palindromes. For each possible leading zero count (from 1 to the length of 'str_N'):\n   - Form 'padded_str' by concatenating leading zeros to 'str_N'.\n   - Check if 'padded_str' is a palindrome. If any 'padded_str' is a palindrome, print 'YES' and terminate. If no palindromic form is found, print 'NO'. Ensure that the leading zeros do not exceed the length of 'str_N'. Handle edge cases where N is 0, as it is inherently a palindrome. Return the final output based on the checks performed.
