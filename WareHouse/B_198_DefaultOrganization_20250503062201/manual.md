# Palindrome Checker

A simple application to check if a given non-negative integer or its padded versions can form a palindrome.

## Main Functions

The Palindrome Checker application includes the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer and validates the input.
2. **Palindrome Check**: Checks if the input integer or its padded versions (with leading zeros) are palindromes.
3. **Output**: Prints "YES" if a palindrome is found, otherwise prints "NO".

## Installation

To run the Palindrome Checker application, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # No external dependencies required for this application
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Palindrome Checker application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the `main.py` script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Non-Negative Integer**:
   When prompted, enter a non-negative integer. The application will validate the input and check if it is a palindrome.

3. **View the Result**:
   The application will output either "YES" or "NO" based on the palindrome check.

### Example Usage

- **Input**: `12321`
  - **Output**: `YES` (because 12321 is a palindrome)

- **Input**: `123`
  - **Output**: `NO` (no padded version forms a palindrome)

- **Input**: `0`
  - **Output**: `YES` (0 is inherently a palindrome)

## Edge Cases

- The application handles the case where the input is `0`, which is inherently a palindrome.
- It also validates against negative integers and non-integer inputs, prompting the user to enter valid data.

## Conclusion

The Palindrome Checker is a straightforward application designed to help users determine if a number or its padded versions can form a palindrome. With easy installation and usage, it serves as a useful tool for anyone interested in number properties.
