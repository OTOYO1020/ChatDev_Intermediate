# Count Equal Pairs

A Python application for counting equal pairs in a list of integers.

## Overview

The `countEqualPairs` application allows users to input a list of integers and calculates the number of ways to choose two distinct equal integers (or "balls") for each position in the list. The application efficiently handles the input and computes results using a frequency dictionary to ensure optimal performance.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer N and a list of integers A from standard input.
- **Count Equal Pairs**: For each integer in the list, the application calculates the number of ways to choose two distinct equal integers, excluding the current integer.
- **Output**: The results for each position in the list are printed in order.

## Installation

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. If you have the files directly, ensure `main.py` and `utils.py` are in the same directory.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the files, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the number of elements (N) followed by the list of integers (space-separated). For example:

   ```
   Enter the number of elements (N): 5
   Enter the list of integers (space-separated): 1 2 3 2 1
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will process the input and print the results for each position in the list.

   ```
   Results:
   2
   2
   1
   2
   2
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the application works:

- Input:
  ```
  Enter the number of elements (N): 4
  Enter the list of integers (space-separated): 1 1 2 2
  ```

- Output:
  ```
  Results:
  1
  1
  1
  1
  ```

## Conclusion

The `countEqualPairs` application is a simple yet powerful tool for counting equal pairs in a list of integers. It efficiently processes input and provides accurate results, making it a valuable resource for developers and data analysts alike.

For any issues or questions, please refer to the code comments or reach out to the development team.
