Define a function named countEqualPairs that takes an integer N and a list of integers A as arguments. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list A from standard input. Initialize a result list to store the answers for each k from 1 to N. For each k from 1 to N, create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of integers in A excluding A[k-1]. For each unique integer in the frequency dictionary, calculate the number of ways to choose two distinct balls using the formula count * (count - 1) / 2. Sum the calculated values for all unique integers to get the total number of ways for the current k. Store the result for the current k in the result list. Repeat steps 4 to 7 for all values of k from 1 to N. After processing all k, print the results stored in the result list. Ensure that the solution runs efficiently within the constraints provided.
