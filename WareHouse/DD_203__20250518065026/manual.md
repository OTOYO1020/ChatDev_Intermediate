# Minimum Median Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum median from KxK subgrids in an NxN grid.

## Introduction

The Minimum Median Calculator allows users to input a grid of integers and specify the size of the subgrid (K). The application will then compute the minimum median value from all possible KxK subgrids within the provided NxN grid. This tool is useful for analyzing grid data in various applications, such as terrain analysis, resource distribution, and more.

## Main Functions

- **Input Grid Size (N)**: Specify the size of the grid (N x N).
- **Input Subgrid Size (K)**: Specify the size of the subgrid (K x K).
- **Input Grid Data**: Enter the grid data as space-separated integers, with each row on a new line.
- **Calculate Minimum Median**: Click the button to compute the minimum median from the specified subgrids.
- **Display Result**: The result will be displayed on the application interface.

## Installation

To run the Minimum Median Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Install Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with most Python installations. If you do not have it, you can install it using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Ubuntu/Linux
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   brew install python-tk  # For macOS
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**: You may need to install additional packages. Use pip to install any required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to launch the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Grid Size and Subgrid Size**:
   - In the input fields, enter the values for N (grid size) and K (subgrid size) separated by a space.

3. **Input Grid Data**:
   - In the text area, enter the grid data. Each row of the grid should be on a new line, with integers separated by spaces. For example:
     ```
     1 2 3
     4 5 6
     7 8 9
     ```

4. **Calculate Minimum Median**:
   - Click the "Calculate Minimum Median" button to compute the result.

5. **View Result**:
   - The minimum median value will be displayed below the button.

## Example Usage

- **Input**:
  ```
  N: 3
  K: 2
  Grid:
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9
  ```

- **Output**:
  ```
  Minimum Median: 4.00
  ```

## Edge Cases

- The application handles edge cases such as:
  - Invalid grid sizes (N and K must be positive integers).
  - Non-integer values in the grid.
  - Subgrid exceeding grid boundaries.

## Support

For any issues or questions, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation for further assistance.
