Read the integer N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'total_cost' to 0 to keep track of the total amount paid by Takahashi. Use a data structure (e.g., a priority queue or a list) to manage the integers on the blackboard, starting with N. While there are integers on the blackboard that are not less than 2:\n   - Select the largest integer 'x' from the blackboard.\n   - Add 'x' to 'total_cost'.\n   - Calculate 'floor(x / 2)' and 'ceil(x / 2)'.\n   - Remove 'x' from the blackboard and add the two new integers 'floor(x / 2)' and 'ceil(x / 2)' to the blackboard. Continue the loop until all integers on the blackboard are less than 2. Print the value of 'total_cost'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently manage the integers on the blackboard and accurately calculate the total cost incurred by Takahashi.
