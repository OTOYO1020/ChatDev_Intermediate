# Takahashi Cost Calculation Program

A simple application to calculate the total cost incurred by Takahashi based on a given integer input.

## Main Functions

The Takahashi Cost Calculation Program performs the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Prompts the user to enter a positive integer \( N \) (greater than or equal to 2).
2. **Cost Calculation**: Calculates the total cost incurred by Takahashi by managing integers on a blackboard using a priority queue.
3. **Output**: Displays the total cost after processing the integers.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Cost Calculation Program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install heapq
   ```

   Note: `heapq` is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required for it.

## How to Use the Program

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Positive Integer**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \) (greater than or equal to 2). For example:

   ```
   Enter a positive integer N (greater than or equal to 2): 10
   ```

3. **View the Total Cost**: After entering a valid integer, the program will calculate the total cost and display it. For example:

   ```
   Total Cost: 10
   ```

4. **Repeat**: You can run the program again to calculate the total cost for a different integer.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the program works:

1. Start the program.
2. Enter `10` when prompted.
3. The program will output the total cost based on the calculations performed on the integers derived from `10`.

## Conclusion

The Takahashi Cost Calculation Program is a straightforward application designed to help users understand how costs can be calculated based on integer manipulation. Feel free to modify the code in `calculator.py` or `main.py` to explore different functionalities or enhancements.
