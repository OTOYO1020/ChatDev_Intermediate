Define a function 'is_multiple_of_3(num: str) -> bool' that checks if the given number represented as a string is a multiple of 3 by calculating the sum of its digits and checking if the sum is divisible by 3. Implement a function 'min_digits_to_erase(N: int) -> Tuple[bool, int]' that takes a positive integer N and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if a multiple of 3 can be formed and the minimum number of digits to erase. Convert the input integer N to a string to facilitate digit manipulation and processing. Calculate the total number of digits 'k' in the string representation of N. Generate all possible combinations of the digits of N by erasing at least 0 and at most k-1 digits. For each combination generated, check if it forms a valid number (i.e., not empty) and if it is a multiple of 3 using the 'is_multiple_of_3' function. Keep track of the minimum number of digits erased for combinations that yield a multiple of 3. If at least one valid combination is found, return True and the minimum number of digits erased; otherwise, return False and -1. Handle the input format by reading the integer N from standard input. Output the result in the format 'Possible: True/False, Minimum digits erased: X'.
