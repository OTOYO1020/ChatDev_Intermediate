Define the function 'min_path_weight(N: int, M: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], K: int, A: List[int], B: List[int])' to handle the input parameters, where 'edges' is a list of tuples representing the edges of the graph with their weights. Parse the input to extract the number of vertices 'N', number of edges 'M', the list of edges with weights, the length of sequences 'K', and the sequences 'A' and 'B'. Construct the graph using an adjacency list representation from the parsed edges. Implement a function 'f(x: int, y: int) -> int' that calculates the minimum possible path weight from vertex 'x' to vertex 'y' using a suitable pathfinding algorithm (e.g., modified Dijkstra's algorithm). Generate all permutations of the sequence 'B' to explore different arrangements. For each permutation of 'B', calculate the total path weight 'sum(f(A[i], B[i]))' for 'i' from '1' to 'K'. Keep track of the minimum total path weight encountered during the permutations. Return the minimum total path weight found after evaluating all permutations. Ensure that the function handles large input sizes efficiently, adhering to the constraints provided. Output the minimum total path weight as the final result.
