Task:
Read integers N, M, and K from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'edges' to store the graph edges. For each edge from 1 to M, read the vertices (a_i, b_i) and add them to the 'edges' list. Create an adjacency list 'graph' to represent the undirected graph using the 'edges' list. Initialize a set 'guarded_vertices' to keep track of all guarded vertices. For each guard i from 1 to K, read the position 'p_i' and stamina 'h_i'. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from vertex 'p_i' to find all vertices that can be reached within 'h_i' edges:\n   - Mark each reachable vertex as guarded by adding it to 'guarded_vertices'. Convert the 'guarded_vertices' set to a sorted list. Print the sorted list of guarded vertices in ascending order.
