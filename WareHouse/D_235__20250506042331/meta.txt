Task:
Read the positive integers 'a' and 'N' from standard input. Initialize a variable 'operations' to count the number of operations performed, starting at 0. Initialize a variable 'x' to 1, representing the initial number on the blackboard. Create a loop that continues until 'x' equals 'N' or 'x' exceeds 'N'. Inside the loop, check if 'x' can be multiplied by 'a':\n   - If 'x * a' is less than or equal to 'N', update 'x' to 'x * a' and increment 'operations'. If 'x' is greater than or equal to 10 and not divisible by 10, perform the string manipulation operation:\n   - Convert 'x' to a string, move the rightmost digit to the front, convert back to an integer, and increment 'operations'. If 'x' becomes equal to 'N', break the loop and prepare to output the result. If the loop ends and 'x' is not equal to 'N', set 'operations' to -1 to indicate that reaching 'N' is impossible. Print the value of 'operations' as the final output.
