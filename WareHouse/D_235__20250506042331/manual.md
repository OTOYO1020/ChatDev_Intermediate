# Operations Calculator

A simple application for performing operations on integers to reach a target number using multiplication and digit manipulation.

## Quick Install

To run the Operations Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can clone the repository or download the source code. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` and `operations.py` files.

### Install Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Operations Calculator allows users to input two positive integers, `a` and `N`. The program will perform a series of operations to determine how many steps it takes to reach the number `N` starting from `1`, using the following rules:

1. Multiply the current number `x` by `a` if the result is less than or equal to `N`.
2. If `x` is greater than or equal to `10` and not divisible by `10`, move the rightmost digit to the front of `x`.
3. The process continues until `x` equals `N` or exceeds `N`.

If `N` cannot be reached, the program will return `-1`.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**:
   When prompted, enter the positive integer `a` followed by the positive integer `N`. For example:

   ```
   Enter a (positive integer): 2
   Enter N (positive integer): 16
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   The program will output the number of operations performed to reach `N`. If it is impossible to reach `N`, it will display `-1`.

   Example output:
   ```
   Operations: 4
   ```

## Example Scenarios

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `a = 2`, `N = 16`
  - Output: `Operations: 4` (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16)

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `a = 3`, `N = 10`
  - Output: `Operations: -1` (Cannot reach 10)

## Error Handling

If you enter a non-positive integer for `a` or `N`, the application will raise an input error:

```
Input Error: Both a and N must be positive integers.
```

## Conclusion

The Operations Calculator is a straightforward tool for exploring number manipulation through multiplication and digit rearrangement. Feel free to modify the code to enhance its functionality or adapt it to your needs.
