Task:
Read integers N and Q from standard input, followed by N integers representing coordinates \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N \) and Q integers representing coordinates \( B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_Q \). Initialize an empty list 'distances' to store the distances between points \( A_i \) and \( B_j \). For each \( j \) from 1 to Q:\n   - Initialize an empty list 'd' to store distances for the current \( B_j \).\n   - For each \( i \) from 1 to N:\n     - Calculate the distance \( d_i = |A_i - B_j| \) and append it to the list 'd'.\n   - Sort the list 'd' in ascending order.\n   - Retrieve the \( k_j \)-th closest distance \( d_{k_j}' \) from the sorted list 'd'. Store the result \( d_{k_j}' \) for each query \( j \). Print all results for each \( j \) in order.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to calculate distance: 'calculate_distance(A, B)'\n- Variable names: 'N', 'Q', 'A', 'B', 'distances', 'd', 'd_i', 'k_j', 'd_{k_j}''.\n\n### Input Format:\n- The input consists of integers N and Q followed by N integers for points \( A \) and Q integers for points \( B \).\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output will be a list of distances \( d_{k_j}' \) for each query \( j \), printed line by line.
