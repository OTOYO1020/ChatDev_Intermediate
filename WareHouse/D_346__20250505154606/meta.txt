Task:
Read the integer N and the string S from standard input. Read the array C of costs corresponding to each character in S. Initialize a variable 'min_cost' to a large value to track the minimum cost of converting S to a good string. Iterate through possible positions 'i' from 1 to N-1:\n   - For each position 'i', calculate the cost of making S a good string by ensuring that S[i] and S[i+1] are the same. For each 'i', consider two scenarios:\n   - Scenario 1: Make S[i] the same as S[i+1] (both '0' or both '1').\n   - Scenario 2: Make S[i+1] the same as S[i] (both '0' or both '1'). Calculate the total cost for each scenario by summing the costs from the array C where changes are made. Update 'min_cost' with the minimum of the current 'min_cost' and the costs calculated from both scenarios. After iterating through all positions, check if 'min_cost' was updated; if not, it means no good string can be formed. Print the final value of 'min_cost' as the minimum total cost required to make S a good string.
