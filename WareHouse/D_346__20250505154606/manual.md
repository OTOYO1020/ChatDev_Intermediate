# Good String Converter

Transforming strings into good strings with minimal cost.

## Overview

The Good String Converter is a Python application designed to convert a given binary string into a "good string" by ensuring that adjacent characters are the same. The conversion is achieved at a minimal cost, which is determined by an array of costs corresponding to each character in the string.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures that the provided inputs (length of the string, the string itself, and the cost array) are valid.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Computes the minimum cost required to convert the string into a good string by evaluating different scenarios for each adjacent character pair.
3. **Output**: Displays the minimum cost or an error message if a good string cannot be formed.

## Installation

To run the Good String Converter, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Good String Converter code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have external dependencies, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## Usage

To use the Good String Converter, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - An integer `N` representing the length of the string.
   - A binary string `S` of length `N`.
   - An array `C` of costs corresponding to each character in `S`, formatted as a comma-separated string.

   Example input:
   ```
   5
   10101
   1,2,3,4,5
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Provide Input**: When prompted, enter the input values in the specified format.

4. **View Output**: The application will output the minimum cost required to convert the string into a good string or an error message if conversion is not possible.

## Example

Here is an example of how to run the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
5
10101
1,2,3,4,5
Minimum Cost: 3
```

In this example, the minimum cost to convert the string `10101` into a good string is `3`.

## Error Handling

- If the input values are invalid (e.g., the length of the string does not match `N`), the application will output:
  ```
  Input Error: Please ensure all inputs are valid.
  ```

- If no good string can be formed, the output will be:
  ```
  No good string can be formed.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Good String Converter is a straightforward tool for transforming binary strings into good strings efficiently. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can easily integrate this tool into your projects or use it for standalone conversions.
