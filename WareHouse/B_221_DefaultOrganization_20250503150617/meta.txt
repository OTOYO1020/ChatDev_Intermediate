Task:
Read the two strings 'S' and 'T' from standard input. Check if 'S' is already equal to 'T'. If they are equal, print 'YES' and terminate. Initialize a variable 'swap_possible' to 'False'. Loop through the indices of the strings from '0' to 'len(S) - 2':\n   - For each index 'i', check if swapping 'S[i]' and 'S[i+1]' makes 'S' equal to 'T'.\n   - If a valid swap is found, set 'swap_possible' to 'True' and break the loop. After the loop, check the value of 'swap_possible':\n   - If 'swap_possible' is 'True', print 'YES'.\n   - If 'swap_possible' is 'False', print 'NO'. Ensure that the lengths of 'S' and 'T' are within the specified range (2 to 100). Handle any edge cases where the strings are not of equal length (though the problem states they will be). Ensure that both strings consist only of lowercase English letters. Return the final result based on the checks performed. Output the result as either 'YES' or 'NO'.
