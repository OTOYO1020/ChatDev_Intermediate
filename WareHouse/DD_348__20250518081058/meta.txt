Task:
Define the function 'canReachGoal(H: int, W: int, grid: List[List[str]], medicines: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> bool' to handle the input parameters: height H, width W, the grid representation, and a list of medicines with their positions and energy values. Parse the input to create a 2D list 'grid' of size H x W, where each cell contains the character representing its state (either '.', '#', 'S', or 'T'). Identify the start position (S) and goal position (T) in the grid, storing their coordinates as 'start' and 'goal' respectively. Store the positions and energy values of the medicines in a list 'medicines' as tuples of the form (R_i, C_i, E_i). Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid starting from the 'start' position, keeping track of the current energy level and the cells visited. For each cell visited, check if it is an empty cell or the goal cell, and if it is a medicine cell, update the energy level accordingly. Ensure that the BFS does not revisit cells and does not exceed the grid boundaries or move into obstacle cells ('#'). If the goal cell (T) is reached during the BFS, return True; otherwise, continue exploring until all possibilities are exhausted. If the BFS completes without reaching the goal, return False. Output the result of the function as either 'YES' if the goal is reachable or 'NO' if it is not.
