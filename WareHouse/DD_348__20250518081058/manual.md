# Grid Navigation Software

Navigate through a grid using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to determine if a goal can be reached from a starting position, while collecting energy from medicines along the way.

## Main Functions

- **canReachGoal(H: int, W: int, grid: List[List[str]], medicines: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> bool**: 
  - This function checks if the goal can be reached from the starting position in the grid. It takes the height and width of the grid, the grid itself, and a list of medicines with their positions and energy values.
  
- **GridInput**: 
  - A class that handles the parsing and validation of grid input, including identifying the start and goal positions and processing the medicines.

## Installation

To run the software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies, such as:

```
# requirements.txt
typing
collections
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input Data**: 
   - The input should be provided in a specific format. The grid should be defined with characters representing different states:
     - `.`: Empty cell
     - `#`: Obstacle
     - `S`: Start position
     - `T`: Goal position
   - Medicines should be defined with their positions and energy values in the format `row,column,energy`.

   Example input:
   ```
   GRID: 
   S..#.
   ..#..
   ..M..
   ..#..
   ...T.
   MEDICINES: 
   2,2,5
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. Make sure to provide the input through standard input or modify the code to read from a file.

   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - The program will output `YES` if the goal is reachable or `NO` if it is not.

## Example Usage

Given the following input:

```
GRID: 
S..#.
..#..
..M..
..#..
...T.
MEDICINES: 
2,2,5
```

Running the command:

```bash
python main.py < input.txt
```

Will output:

```
YES
```

## Conclusion

This software provides a robust way to navigate through grids and determine reachability to a goal while collecting energy from medicines. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to our support team.
