# Lattice Point Counter

A Python application for calculating the number of valid lattice points within specified Manhattan distances in N-dimensional space.

## Quick Install

To run the Lattice Point Counter, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# No external dependencies are required for this application
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Lattice Point Counter is designed to help users calculate the number of lattice points that satisfy specific distance conditions in N-dimensional space. It utilizes the concept of Manhattan distance to determine the proximity of points.

### Main Functions

1. **manhattan_distance(point_a, point_b)**: 
   - Calculates the Manhattan distance between two points in N-dimensional space.
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `point_a`: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the first point.
     - `point_b`: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the second point.
   - **Returns**: An integer representing the Manhattan distance.

2. **is_lattice_point(point)**: 
   - Checks if a given point is a lattice point (i.e., all components are integers).
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `point`: A list of integers representing the coordinates of the point.
   - **Returns**: A boolean indicating whether the point is a lattice point.

3. **count_lattice_points(p, q, D)**: 
   - Counts the number of lattice points `r` satisfying the conditions `d(p, r) <= D` and `d(q, r) <= D`.
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `p`: A list of integers representing the coordinates of point `p`.
     - `q`: A list of integers representing the coordinates of point `q`.
     - `D`: A non-negative integer representing the maximum distance.
   - **Returns**: An integer representing the count of valid lattice points, computed modulo 998244353.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: 
   - Create a text file or prepare standard input with the following format:
     ```
     p_x1,p_x2,...,p_xN
     q_x1,q_x2,...,q_xN
     D
     ```
   - Where `p` and `q` are the coordinates of the points in N-dimensional space, and `D` is the maximum distance.

2. **Run the Application**: 
   - Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```
   - Replace `input.txt` with the name of your input file or provide input directly in the terminal.

3. **Output**: 
   - The application will output the number of valid lattice points that satisfy the distance conditions.

## Example

Given the following input:
```
1,2
3,4
2
```

The output will be:
```
Number of valid lattice points: X
```
Where `X` is the count of valid lattice points calculated by the application.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following cases:
- Points `p` and `q` must have the same dimensionality.
- All coordinates of points `p` and `q` must be integers.
- Points must have at least one dimension.
- Distance `D` must be a non-negative integer.
- Invalid input formats will prompt an error message.

## Conclusion

The Lattice Point Counter is a powerful tool for researchers and developers working with N-dimensional spaces. It simplifies the process of counting lattice points based on specified distance constraints, making it easier to analyze geometric properties in higher dimensions.
