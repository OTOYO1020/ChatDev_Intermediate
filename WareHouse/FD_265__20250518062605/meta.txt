Task:
Define a function 'manhattan_distance(point_a, point_b)' that calculates the Manhattan distance between two points in N-dimensional space. Define a function 'is_lattice_point(point)' that checks if a given point is a lattice point (i.e., all components are integers). Implement a function 'count_lattice_points(p, q, D)' that counts the number of lattice points r satisfying d(p, r) <= D and d(q, r) <= D. Generate all possible lattice points r within the bounding box defined by the Manhattan distances from p and q, considering the constraints of D. For each generated lattice point r, use 'manhattan_distance(p, r)' and 'manhattan_distance(q, r)' to check if both distances are less than or equal to D. Maintain a count of valid lattice points that satisfy both distance conditions. Ensure that the count of valid lattice points is computed modulo 998244353. Handle input reading to extract values for N, D, and the coordinates of points p and q. Pass the extracted arguments to the 'count_lattice_points(p, q, D)' function. Output the final count of valid lattice points.
