Task:
Define a function 'minimum_magic_points(H: int, N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int' to calculate the minimum total Magic Points needed. Parse the input values for 'H', 'N', 'A', and 'B' from the standard input. Initialize a variable 'min_magic_points' to a large value to keep track of the minimum Magic Points required. Implement a loop to iterate through all possible combinations of spells to determine the minimum Magic Points needed to reduce the monster's health to 0 or below. For each spell, calculate how many times it needs to be cast to reduce the monster's health and compute the total Magic Points consumed. Update 'min_magic_points' whenever a lower total Magic Points value is found during the iterations. Ensure that the solution accounts for the possibility of casting the same spell multiple times. Return the value of 'min_magic_points' as the output of the function. Handle edge cases where 'H' is already 0 or less at the start. Print the output in the required format after calling the function.
