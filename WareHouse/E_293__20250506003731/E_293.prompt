Read integers A, X, and M from standard input. Initialize a variable 'result' to 0 to store the cumulative sum. Check if A is equal to 1:\n   - If true, compute 'result = (X % M)' since the sum of 1 raised to any power is simply X. If A is greater than 1, initialize a variable 'current_term' to 1 (which represents A^0). Loop from i = 0 to X - 1:\n   - Update 'result' by adding 'current_term' and taking modulo M: 'result = (result + current_term) % M'.\n   - Update 'current_term' to 'current_term * A % M' to compute A^i for the next iteration. Print the final value of 'result'.
