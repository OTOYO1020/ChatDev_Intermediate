Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the size of the chessboard. Read N strings \( S_i \) from standard input, which represent the rows of the chessboard. Read the starting position \( (A_x, A_y) \) and the target position \( (B_x, B_y) \) from standard input. Initialize a data structure (e.g., a queue) to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) for the bishop's movement. Create a function 'is_valid_move(x, y)' to check if the square \( (x, y) \) is within the bounds of the board and not occupied by a pawn. Implement the BFS algorithm to explore all possible moves of the bishop from \( (A_x, A_y) \) to \( (B_x, B_y) \):\n   - For each position, check all four diagonal directions.\n   - For each direction, move in increments until hitting a boundary or a pawn.\n   - Add valid positions to the queue for further exploration. Track the number of moves taken to reach each position using a distance array or similar structure. If the target position \( (B_x, B_y) \) is reached, return the number of moves taken. If the target position cannot be reached, return -1. Print the result (either the number of moves or -1) as the output.
