Define a function 'max_product_of_separated_integers(N: int) -> int' to calculate the maximum product of two positive integers formed by permuting the digits of N. Convert the integer N into a string to facilitate digit manipulation. Generate all unique permutations of the digits of N using 'itertools.permutations'. For each permutation, split the digits into two non-empty parts in all possible ways. Ensure that neither of the resulting integers from the split has leading zeros or is zero. Convert the valid splits back into integers. Calculate the product of the two integers for each valid split. Keep track of the maximum product found during the iterations. Return the maximum product as the output of the function. Output the result in the format of a single integer representing the maximum product.
