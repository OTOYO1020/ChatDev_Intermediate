Define a function 'determine_survivors(N: int, K: int, Q: int, A: List[int]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Initialize a list 'scores' of size N with each element set to K, representing the initial scores of all players. Iterate through the list A of correct answers, and for each answer, decrement the score of all players except the one who answered correctly. After processing all answers, check each player's score in the 'scores' list to determine if it is greater than 0. Create a list 'survivors' to store the indices of players who have scores greater than 0. Return the 'survivors' list as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when all players are eliminated. Implement input reading to parse the values of N, K, Q, and the list A from standard input. Implement output formatting to print the indices of surviving players in ascending order. Test the function with various test cases to ensure correctness and performance within the given constraints.
