Define the function signature as 'def max_area_cut(W: int, H: int, x: int, y: int) -> Tuple[int, bool]:' to handle the input parameters. Implement input handling to read integers W, H, x, and y from standard input. Calculate the total area of the rectangle using the formula 'total_area = W * H'. Determine the area of the two parts after cutting the rectangle with a line through point (x, y). Identify the maximum possible area of the smaller part using the formula 'max_area = total_area // 2'. Check if the maximum area can be achieved by multiple cutting lines, and set a boolean flag accordingly. Return the maximum area and the boolean flag as a tuple from the function. Implement output handling to print the results in the format 'max_area is X and multiple ways: Y'. Ensure that all calculations handle the constraints of the problem, particularly the large values of W and H. Test the function with various inputs to validate correctness and performance.
