# Max Area Calculator

A simple application to calculate the maximum area of a rectangle after making a cut through a specified point.

## Main Functions

The Max Area Calculator provides the following functionalities:

- **Calculate Total Area**: Computes the total area of a rectangle given its width (W) and height (H).
- **Determine Areas After Cut**: Calculates the areas of the four parts created by cutting the rectangle through a specified point (x, y).
- **Identify Maximum Area**: Determines the maximum possible area of the smaller part after the cut.
- **Check for Multiple Cutting Lines**: Identifies if there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum area.

## Installation

To run the Max Area Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install typing
```

(Note: The `typing` module is included in Python 3.5 and later, so you may not need to install it separately.)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run the Application

To use the Max Area Calculator, run the `main.py` file. You can do this by navigating to the directory where the file is located and executing:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Input Parameters

When prompted, enter the width (W), height (H), and the coordinates of the cut point (x, y) separated by spaces. For example:

```
Enter Width (W), Height (H), x, y: 10 5 3 2
```

### Step 3: View Results

After entering the parameters, the application will calculate and display the maximum area of the smaller part and whether there are multiple ways to achieve that area. The output will be in the following format:

```
max_area is X and multiple ways: Y
```

Where `X` is the maximum area and `Y` is a boolean indicating if there are multiple ways to achieve that area.

## Example Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use the Max Area Calculator:

1. **Example 1**:
   ```
   Enter Width (W), Height (H), x, y: 10 5 3 2
   max_area is 25 and multiple ways: False
   ```

2. **Example 2**:
   ```
   Enter Width (W), Height (H), x, y: 8 6 4 3
   max_area is 24 and multiple ways: True
   ```

## Testing the Function

You can test the function with various inputs to validate its correctness and performance. Ensure that the inputs adhere to the constraints (W > 0, H > 0, 0 <= x <= W, 0 <= y <= H).

## Conclusion

The Max Area Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating areas after making a cut in a rectangle. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for quick calculations in various applications.
