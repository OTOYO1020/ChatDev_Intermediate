Task:
Read the positive integer \( N \) from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'result' to store the characters of the output string. For each integer \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( N \) (inclusive):\n   - Initialize a variable 'found' to 'False'.\n   - For each divisor \( j \) of \( N \) in the range \( 1 \) to \( 9 \):\n     - Check if \( i \) is a multiple of \( N/j \):\n       - If true, append the character corresponding to \( j \) (as a string) to 'result', set 'found' to 'True', and break the loop.\n   - If no divisor \( j \) was found that satisfies the condition, append ''-'' to 'result'. Join the elements of 'result' into a single string 'output_string'. Print 'output_string'.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all requirements of the problem statement are met while maintaining clarity in the implementation steps.
