# Number Processing Application

A simple Python application that processes a positive integer \( N \) and generates a specific output string based on its divisors.

## Main Functions

The application reads a positive integer \( N \) from standard input and performs the following operations:

1. Initializes an empty list to store the output characters.
2. Iterates through each integer \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( N \) (inclusive).
3. For each integer \( i \):
   - Checks for divisors \( j \) of \( N \) in the range \( 1 \) to \( 9 \).
   - If \( i \) is a multiple of \( N/j \), it appends the character corresponding to \( j \) to the result list.
   - If no valid divisor is found, it appends a '-' to the result list.
4. Joins the result list into a single output string and prints it.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any additional dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Positive Integer**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \) to process. For example:
   ```
   Please enter a positive integer N to process: 12
   ```

3. **View the Output**: The application will process the input and print the resulting output string based on the defined logic. For example, if you input `12`, you might see an output like:
   ```
   1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how the application works:

- Input: `6`
- Output: `1-2-3-4-5-6`

This indicates that for each integer from `0` to `6`, the application found corresponding divisors or appended '-' where applicable.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter a non-positive integer or a non-integer value, the application will prompt you to enter a valid positive integer.
- **Execution Errors**: Ensure that you are using Python 3.x. If you encounter any issues, check your Python installation and ensure that the script is being run in an appropriate environment.

## Support

For any issues or questions regarding the application, please contact the support team or refer to the documentation for further assistance.
