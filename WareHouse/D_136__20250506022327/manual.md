# Children Movement Simulation

A Python application to simulate the movement of children based on a string of 'L' (left) and 'R' (right) commands.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a movement string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters, simulating the movement of children across a series of squares. Each square initially contains one child, and the program calculates the final distribution of children after processing the movement commands.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads a string of movements from the user, ensuring it only contains 'L' and 'R' characters and has a valid length.
- **Simulation Logic**: Calculates the final positions of children based on the movement commands without simulating each individual move, making it efficient even for large inputs.
- **Output**: Displays the final count of children on each square after processing the movement commands.

## Installation

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application requires no additional dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Simply ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the simulation.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Movement String**: When prompted, enter a movement string consisting of 'L' and 'R'. Ensure the string length is between 2 and 100,000 characters.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter movement string (L/R): RLRLRL
   ```

4. **View Results**: After processing the input, the application will output the final distribution of children across the squares.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Children on each square: [2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1]
   ```

## Example

To illustrate how the application works, consider the following example:

- Input: `RLRLRL`
- Output: `Children on each square: [2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1]`

This indicates that after processing the movements, the first square has 2 children, the second square has 3, and so on.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to simulate the movement of children based on directional commands. It is designed to handle large inputs efficiently, making it suitable for various scenarios where such simulations are needed.
