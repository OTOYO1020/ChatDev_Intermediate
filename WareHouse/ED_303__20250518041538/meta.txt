Task:
Parse the input to read the integer N and the edges (u_i, v_i) that define the tree T. Store the edges in a suitable data structure, such as a list of tuples or a dictionary. Create a function called 'is_star' that checks if a given graph with k+1 vertices and k edges is a level-k star. Implement a function 'count_stars' that iterates through the edges of the tree T and counts how many level-k stars can be formed based on the degree of vertices. For each vertex in the tree T, calculate its degree and store the results in a list or dictionary for easy access. Identify all vertices with degree 1 and store them in a separate list, as they are potential candidates for forming stars. Group the vertices by their degrees to facilitate the identification of stars in the tree. Implement logic to determine how many stars can be formed from the identified vertices with degree 1, ensuring that the conditions for a level-k star are met. Create a function 'output_results' that formats the output to display the number and levels of the stars found in the tree T. Ensure that the solution adheres to the constraints provided, particularly the limits on N and the values of u_i and v_i. Return the output in the specified format after processing the tree T and identifying the stars.
