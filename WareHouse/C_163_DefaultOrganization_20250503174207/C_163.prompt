Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of members in the company. Initialize an array 'subordinates_count' of size N+1 (to accommodate 1-based indexing) with all values set to 0 to store the count of immediate subordinates for each member. Read the array 'A' of size N-1 from standard input, where each element 'A[i]' represents the immediate boss of member 'i+2'. Iterate through the array 'A':\n   - For each member 'i' (from 2 to N), increment the subordinate count of their boss 'A[i-2]' in the 'subordinates_count' array. Prepare the output by collecting the subordinate counts from 'subordinates_count' for members 1 to N. Print the subordinate counts for each member from 1 to N, each on a new line.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that we efficiently count the immediate subordinates for each member based on the given boss relationships.
