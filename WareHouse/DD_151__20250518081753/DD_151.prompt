Define the function 'max_moves(H: int, W: int, S: List[str]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where H is the number of rows, W is the number of columns, and S is the list of strings representing the maze. Parse the input to extract the dimensions H and W, and the maze representation S from the input format. Implement a method to identify all road squares ('.') in the maze and store their coordinates in a list. Create a function to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the shortest path between any two road squares in the maze. Iterate through all pairs of road squares and use the BFS/DFS function to determine the minimum number of moves required to travel between them. Keep track of the maximum number of moves found during the iteration over all pairs of road squares. Ensure that the BFS/DFS function correctly handles walls ('#') and does not allow movement out of the maze boundaries. Implement error handling for edge cases, such as ensuring there are at least two road squares in the maze. Test the function with various maze configurations to ensure correctness and efficiency given the constraints. Return the maximum number of moves as the output of the function in the format of an integer.
