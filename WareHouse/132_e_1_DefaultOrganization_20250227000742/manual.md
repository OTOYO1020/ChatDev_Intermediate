# Shortest Path Application

This application implements a shortest path algorithm on a transformed graph structure using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The graph is represented in a three-layer structure where each vertex has three states based on modulo 3.

## Main Functions

- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using a three-layer structure where each vertex `v` is expanded into three nodes: `(v,0)`, `(v,1)`, and `(v,2)`.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: The application calculates the shortest path from a starting vertex `S` to a target vertex `T` using BFS.
- **Input/Output**: The application reads input from standard input and outputs the result to standard output.

## Installation

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## How to Use

1. **Input Format**: The input should be provided in the following format:
   - The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of vertices.
   - The second line contains an integer `M`, the number of edges.
   - The third line contains the starting vertex `S`.
   - The fourth line contains the target vertex `T`.
   - The next `M` lines each contain two integers `ui` and `vi`, representing an edge between vertices `ui` and `vi`.

   Example Input:
   ```
   5
   6
   1
   5
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   4 5
   1 5
   2 4
   ```

2. **Running the Application**: You can run the application by executing the `main.py` script. Make sure to provide the input in the specified format.

   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

   Here, `input.txt` is a file containing the input data as described above.

3. **Output**: The application will output the shortest distance from `(S,0)` to `(T,0)` divided by three. If no valid path exists, it will output `-1`.

   Example Output:
   ```
   2
   ```

## Computational Complexity

The implementation is optimized to run in O(N + M) time complexity, ensuring efficiency even under the constraints where `N` and `M` can be as large as 100,000.

## Conclusion

This application provides a robust solution for finding the shortest path in a transformed graph structure. It is designed to be efficient and easy to use, making it suitable for various applications in graph theory and pathfinding algorithms.
