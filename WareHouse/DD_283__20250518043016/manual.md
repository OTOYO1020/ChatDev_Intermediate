Here is the `manual.md` file for the software that implements the function `can_complete_operations` to check if Takahashi can complete the sequence of operations without fainting.

# Takahashi Operations Checker

A Python application to determine if Takahashi can complete a sequence of operations without fainting by managing a set of balls and validating parentheses.

## Main Functions

- **can_complete_operations(S: str) -> bool**: This function checks if Takahashi can complete the operations defined in the string `S`. It tracks lowercase letters (balls) and validates the parentheses structure to ensure that Takahashi does not faint.

## Quick Install

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies if you have any specific libraries to include. For this application, no external libraries are required beyond Python's standard library.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   First, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the `main.py` file to start the application. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Sequence of Operations**:
   When prompted, enter the sequence of operations as a string. The string can contain lowercase English letters (representing balls) and parentheses `(` and `)`.

   Example input:
   ```
   a(bc)d(e)f
   ```

4. **View the Result**:
   After entering the sequence, the application will output whether Takahashi can complete the operations or if he faints.

   Example output:
   ```
   Takahashi can complete the operations.
   ```

   If the sequence is invalid and causes Takahashi to faint, the output will be:
   ```
   Takahashi faints!
   ```

## Example Usage

Here are a few examples of valid and invalid sequences:

- **Valid Sequence**: `a(b)c(d)e`
- **Invalid Sequence**: `a(bc)d(e)f(a)`

## Additional Information

For more details on the implementation, you can refer to the source code in `operations.py` where the logic for checking the operations is defined.
