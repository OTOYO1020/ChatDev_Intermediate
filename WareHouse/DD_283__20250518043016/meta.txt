Task:
Define the function 'can_complete_operations(S: str) -> bool' to check if Takahashi can complete the sequence of operations without fainting. Initialize an empty set 'box' to keep track of the balls in the box. Iterate through each character in the string 'S' using a loop with index 'i' from 0 to |S|-1. For each character 'S[i]', check if it is a lowercase English letter. If it is, check if it is already in 'box'. If it is, return False (Takahashi faints). Otherwise, add it to 'box'. If 'S[i]' is '(', do nothing and continue to the next character. If 'S[i]' is ')', find the maximum integer 'j' less than 'i' such that the substring 'S[j:i+1]' is a good string. To check if 'S[j:i+1]' is a good string, define a helper function 'is_good_string(sub: str) -> bool' that removes all lowercase letters and checks if the remaining string can be reduced to an empty string by removing consecutive '()'. If 'S[j:i+1]' is a good string, remove all balls from 'box' that were added in the operations from 'j' to 'i'. Continue the loop until all characters in 'S' have been processed. Return True if all operations are completed without fainting.
