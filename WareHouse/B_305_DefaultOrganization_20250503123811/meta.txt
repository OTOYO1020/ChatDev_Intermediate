Task:
Read the two uppercase English letters 'p' and 'q' from standard input. Define a list 'points' containing the positions of points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G based on the given distances:\n   - 'points = [0, 3, 4, 8, 9, 14, 19, 28]' (where each index corresponds to A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6). Create a mapping 'point_index' to associate each letter with its corresponding index in the 'points' list:\n   - 'point_index = {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'G': 6}'. Retrieve the indices of points 'p' and 'q' using the mapping: \n   - 'index_p = point_index[p]'\n   - 'index_q = point_index[q]'. Calculate the distance between points 'p' and 'q' using the formula:\n   - 'distance = abs(points[index_p] - points[index_q])'. Print the calculated distance.
