Task:
Define the function 'find_kth_product(N: int, K: int, A: List[int])' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract integers N, K, and the list A of size N. Generate all possible pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i < j <= N to compute their products. Store the products of the pairs in a list called 'products'. Sort the 'products' list in ascending order. Access the K-th element in the sorted 'products' list (considering 1-based indexing). Return the K-th product as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as maximum constraints on N and K. Implement input validation to ensure all values meet the specified constraints. Format the output to display the K-th product as an integer.
