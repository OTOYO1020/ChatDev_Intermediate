# K-th Product Calculator

A simple application to compute the K-th product of unique pairs from a list of integers.

## Overview

The K-th Product Calculator allows users to input a list of integers and retrieve the K-th product of all unique pairs formed from the list. This application is useful for mathematical computations involving combinations of numbers.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user for input values, including the number of elements (N), the index of the desired product (K), and the list of integers (A).
- **Product Calculation**: The application generates all unique pairs of integers from the list, computes their products, and sorts them in ascending order.
- **Output**: The application returns the K-th product based on 1-based indexing.

## Installation

To run the K-th Product Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application requires no additional dependencies beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python version 3.6 or higher.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the K-th Product Calculator code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the K-th Product Calculator.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Values**: Follow the prompts to enter the required values:
   - **Enter N**: The number of elements in the list (must be a positive integer).
   - **Enter K**: The index of the product you want to retrieve (must be a positive integer).
   - **Enter list A**: A comma-separated list of integers (must be unique and match the length of N).

4. **View the Result**: After entering the values, the application will compute and display the K-th product.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter N: 5
Enter K: 3
Enter list A (comma-separated): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
K-th Product: 6
```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure that:
- N and K are positive integers.
- The length of list A matches N.
- All elements in A are unique integers.
- K is within the valid range of products generated.

If any input is invalid, an error message will be displayed, guiding the user to correct their input.

## Conclusion

The K-th Product Calculator is a straightforward tool for computing products of integer pairs. It is designed to be user-friendly and robust, ensuring accurate results while handling various edge cases.
