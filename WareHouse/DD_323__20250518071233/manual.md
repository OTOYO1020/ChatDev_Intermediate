# Slime Synthesizer

A Python application for synthesizing slimes based on their sizes and counts, optimizing the process to minimize the number of slimes remaining after synthesis.

## Quick Install

To run the Slime Synthesizer, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## 🤔 What is Slime Synthesizer?

The Slime Synthesizer is designed to help users manage and synthesize slimes of various sizes. The main functionality revolves around taking different sizes of slimes and their respective counts, pairing them optimally, and returning the minimum number of slimes that remain after all possible syntheses.

### Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of slime sizes, their respective sizes, and counts from user input.
- **Synthesis Logic**: The core logic encapsulated in the `SlimeSynthesizer` class processes the sizes and counts to form pairs and synthesize slimes iteratively.
- **Output**: The application outputs the minimum number of slimes remaining after all possible syntheses.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the following:
   - The number of sizes (N).
   - The sizes of the slimes as a comma-separated list (e.g., `1,2,3`).
   - The counts of each size as a comma-separated list (e.g., `5,3,2`).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the number of sizes: 3
   Enter sizes (comma-separated): 1,2,3
   Enter counts (comma-separated): 5,3,2
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the inputs, the application will process the data and output the minimum number of slimes remaining.

   Example output:
   ```
   Minimum slimes remaining: 4
   ```

## 🛠️ Dependencies

The Slime Synthesizer requires Python 3.x and the following dependencies:
- `typing`: This is used for type hinting in the code.

Make sure to install the dependencies before running the application.

## 📝 Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to manage common issues:
- If the sizes and counts do not match in length, an error message will be displayed.
- Any other exceptions will also be caught and displayed to the user.

## 🚀 Example Use Case

Consider a scenario where you have slimes of sizes 1, 2, and 3 with counts of 5, 3, and 2 respectively. After running the application and inputting these values, the Slime Synthesizer will calculate the optimal synthesis and return the minimum number of slimes remaining.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

Future versions of the Slime Synthesizer may include:
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback.
- Additional features for more complex slime synthesis scenarios.
