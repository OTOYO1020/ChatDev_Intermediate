Read integers X and Y from standard input, ensuring they are within the constraints (1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10^6). Initialize a 2D array 'ways' of size (X+1) x (Y+1) to store the number of ways to reach each square. Set the starting position 'ways[0][0] = 1' since there is one way to be at the origin. Loop through each cell in the grid from (0, 0) to (X, Y):\n   - For each cell (i, j), if moving to (i+1, j+2) is within bounds, update 'ways[i+1][j+2]' by adding 'ways[i][j]'.\n   - If moving to (i+2, j+1) is within bounds, update 'ways[i+2][j+1]' by adding 'ways[i][j]'. Ensure to take modulo '10^9 + 7' for each update to prevent overflow. After filling the 'ways' array, the result will be stored in 'ways[X][Y]'. Print the result 'ways[X][Y]' as the final output.
