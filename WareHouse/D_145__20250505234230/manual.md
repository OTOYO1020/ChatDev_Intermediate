# Grid Pathways Calculator

A Python application to calculate the number of ways to reach a target cell in a grid using specific movement rules.

## Main Functions

The Grid Pathways Calculator allows users to:
- Input two integers, X and Y, representing the target cell coordinates in a grid.
- Calculate the number of distinct ways to reach the cell (X, Y) from the origin (0, 0) using the following movement rules:
  - Move to (i+1, j+2)
  - Move to (i+2, j+1)
- Output the result while ensuring that the calculations are performed under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.

## Quick Install

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install any required dependencies (if applicable). For this application, there are no external dependencies, but ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values:**
   The application will prompt you to enter two integers, X and Y. Ensure that both values are within the constraints (1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10^6). If the input is invalid, the application will prompt you to enter the values again.

   ```
   Enter X (1 ≤ X ≤ 10^6): 
   Enter Y (1 ≤ Y ≤ 10^6): 
   ```

3. **View Results:**
   After entering valid inputs, the application will calculate the number of ways to reach the target cell (X, Y) and display the result:

   ```
   Ways to reach (X, Y): [result]
   ```

## Example Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter valid coordinates:

   ```
   Enter X (1 ≤ X ≤ 10^6): 3
   Enter Y (1 ≤ Y ≤ 10^6): 3
   ```

3. Output will be:

   ```
   Ways to reach (3, 3): 2
   ```

## Additional Information

- The application is designed to handle large values efficiently, but keep in mind that extremely high values may require significant memory.
- The logic for calculating the number of ways is encapsulated in the `GridLogic` class, which can be modified or extended for additional functionality if needed.
