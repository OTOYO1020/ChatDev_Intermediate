Task:
Define the function 'count_remaining_walls(H: int, W: int, Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int' to handle the input parameters. Initialize a grid of size H x W filled with walls, represented as a 2D list or array. Iterate through each query in 'queries', extracting R_q and C_q for each query. For each query, check if there is a wall at (R_q, C_q). If yes, destroy the wall at that position. If there is no wall at (R_q, C_q), check the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions to find the first wall to destroy. Implement the logic to search upwards from (R_q, C_q) for the first wall, ensuring no walls are present in between. Implement the logic to search downwards from (R_q, C_q) for the first wall, ensuring no walls are present in between. Implement the logic to search left from (R_q, C_q) for the first wall, ensuring no walls are present in between. Implement the logic to search right from (R_q, C_q) for the first wall, ensuring no walls are present in between. After processing all queries, count and return the number of remaining walls in the grid.
