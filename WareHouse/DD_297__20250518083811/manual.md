# Count Operations Application

A simple application to count the number of operations required to make two integers equal by repeatedly subtracting the smaller from the larger.

## Main Functions

- **count_operations(A: int, B: int) -> int**: This function takes two positive integers A and B as input and returns the number of operations required to make them equal. The operations consist of subtracting the smaller integer from the larger until both integers are equal.

- **Input Handling**: The application includes input handling to ensure that the user provides valid positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18.

- **Validation**: The application validates user input to ensure that it meets the specified constraints.

## Installation Instructions

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies, you can install them using pip. For this application, there are no external dependencies required beyond Python itself.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements.txt file is provided
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: The application will prompt you to enter two positive integers A and B. You can enter the values directly into the console.

   ```
   Enter the first positive integer A (or type 'exit' to quit): 
   Enter the second positive integer B (or type 'exit' to quit): 
   ```

3. **Exit Option**: If you wish to exit the application at any time, you can type 'exit' when prompted for input.

4. **View Results**: After entering valid integers, the application will calculate the number of operations required to make A equal to B and print the result to the console.

   ```
   <result>
   ```

## Example Usage

- **Example 1**:
   ```
   Enter the first positive integer A (or type 'exit' to quit): 15
   Enter the second positive integer B (or type 'exit' to quit): 10
   2
   ```

- **Example 2**:
   ```
   Enter the first positive integer A (or type 'exit' to quit): 100
   Enter the second positive integer B (or type 'exit' to quit): 75
   3
   ```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to count the operations required to make two integers equal. It includes input validation to ensure that the user inputs valid integers within the specified range. For any issues or feedback, please contact the support team.
