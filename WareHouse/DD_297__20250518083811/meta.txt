Task:
Define a function named 'count_operations(A: int, B: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting the operations until A equals B. Implement input handling to read two positive integers A and B from standard input. Ensure that the input values A and B are within the constraints of 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^18. Initialize a counter variable 'count' to zero to keep track of the number of operations performed. Create a loop that continues until A equals B. Inside the loop, compare A and B; if A > B, update A to A - B; if A < B, update B to B - A. Increment the 'count' variable by 1 after each operation. After exiting the loop, return the value of 'count' as the result of the function. Call the 'count_operations' function with the input values A and B and store the result. Print the result to standard output.
