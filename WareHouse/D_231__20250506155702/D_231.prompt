Read integers N and M from standard input, where N is the number of people and M is the number of adjacency conditions. Initialize an adjacency list 'adjacency_list' to store pairs of adjacent persons. For each of the M conditions, read pairs (A_i, B_i) and populate the 'adjacency_list' with these pairs. Create a function 'can_line_up(adjacency_list)' that checks if a valid arrangement of people can satisfy all adjacency conditions. In 'can_line_up', use a graph traversal method (like DFS or BFS) to explore the adjacency relationships. Check for cycles in the graph; if a cycle exists, return False as it is impossible to line up the people. If no cycles are found, return True indicating a valid arrangement is possible. Call 'can_line_up(adjacency_list)' and store the result. Print YES if a valid arrangement exists, otherwise print NO.
