# Adjacency Condition Checker

The Adjacency Condition Checker is a Python application designed to determine if a valid arrangement of people can satisfy specified adjacency conditions. This software utilizes graph traversal techniques to check for cycles in the adjacency relationships among individuals.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of people (N) and the number of adjacency conditions (M) from standard input.
2. **Adjacency List Initialization**: It initializes an adjacency list to store pairs of adjacent persons.
3. **Cycle Detection**: The core functionality is encapsulated in the `can_line_up` function, which checks for cycles in the graph representation of the adjacency conditions using Depth-First Search (DFS).
4. **Output**: The application outputs "YES" if a valid arrangement exists and "NO" if it does not.

## Installation

To run the Adjacency Condition Checker, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (if not already provided):
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```
   Then, install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Input Format**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of people (N) and the number of adjacency conditions (M) separated by a space.
   - For each adjacency condition, enter pairs of integers (A, B) on a new line, where A and B are the indices of adjacent persons (0-indexed).

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter number of people (N) and number of adjacency conditions (M): 4 3
   Enter pairs (A, B) for adjacency conditions (0-indexed, one pair per line):
   0 1
   1 2
   2 3
   ```

2. **Output**:
   - After entering all the pairs, the application will output either "YES" if a valid arrangement exists or "NO" if it does not.

## Error Handling

- The application includes input validation to ensure that:
  - The number of people (N) is greater than zero.
  - The pairs of indices (A, B) are within the valid range [0, N-1].
  - Self-loops (where A equals B) are not allowed.
  - Duplicate pairs are not added to the adjacency list.

## Future Expansions

If you wish to expand the functionality of the application or include additional libraries, you can do so by editing the `requirements.txt` file and adding the necessary packages.
