# Matrix Transformation Checker

A simple application to determine if one matrix can be transformed into another based on their dimensions and element occurrences.

## Quick Install

To run the Matrix Transformation Checker, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: If there are no specific dependencies, you can skip this step.)*

## ü§î What is this?

The Matrix Transformation Checker allows users to input two matrices and checks if the first matrix (A) can be transformed into the second matrix (B). The transformation is possible if:

1. Matrix A has at least as many rows and columns as Matrix B.
2. All elements of Matrix B can be found in Matrix A, allowing for duplicates.

This application is useful for mathematical computations, data analysis, and educational purposes.

## üìñ How to Use

### Step 1: Run the Application

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Input Matrix Dimensions

You will be prompted to enter the dimensions of Matrix A and Matrix B:

```
Enter dimensions of matrix A (H1 W1):
```

- Input the number of rows (H1) and columns (W1) for Matrix A, separated by a space (e.g., `3 2` for a 3x2 matrix).

### Step 3: Input Matrix A Values

Next, you will be asked to input the values for Matrix A:

```
Enter matrix A values row by row (space-separated integers):
```

- Enter each row of the matrix as space-separated integers. For example, for a 3x2 matrix, you might input:

```
1 2
3 4
5 6
```

### Step 4: Input Matrix Dimensions for Matrix B

You will then input the dimensions for Matrix B:

```
Enter dimensions of matrix B (H2 W2):
```

- Again, input the number of rows (H2) and columns (W2) for Matrix B.

### Step 5: Input Matrix B Values

You will be prompted to enter the values for Matrix B:

```
Enter matrix B values row by row (space-separated integers):
```

- Input each row of Matrix B in the same manner as Matrix A.

### Step 6: View Results

After entering both matrices, the application will check if Matrix A can be transformed into Matrix B. The result will be displayed as:

```
YES
```

or

```
NO
```

## üìú Example

Here‚Äôs an example of how the input and output might look:

```
Enter dimensions of matrix A (H1 W1): 3 2
Enter matrix A values row by row (space-separated integers):
1 2
3 4
5 6
Enter dimensions of matrix B (H2 W2): 2 2
Enter matrix B values row by row (space-separated integers):
1 2
3 4
YES
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter a row with an incorrect number of elements, the application will prompt you to try again.
- **Negative Dimensions**: The application will not accept negative or zero dimensions for the matrices.
