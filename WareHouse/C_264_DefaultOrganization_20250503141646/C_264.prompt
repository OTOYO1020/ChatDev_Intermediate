Read the dimensions of matrix A (H1, W1) and matrix B (H2, W2) from standard input. Initialize matrix A with dimensions H1 x W1 and populate it with values A[i][j] from input. Initialize matrix B with dimensions H2 x W2 and populate it with values B[i][j] from input. Create a function 'can_transform(A, B)' to determine if matrix A can be transformed into matrix B. In 'can_transform', check if the number of rows in A is greater than or equal to the number of rows in B and the number of columns in A is greater than or equal to the number of columns in B. If the dimensions condition is satisfied, check if all elements of matrix B can be found in matrix A, allowing for duplicates. If all elements of B can be matched with elements in A, return True; otherwise, return False. Call 'can_transform(A, B)' and store the result. Print YES if the result is True, otherwise print NO.
