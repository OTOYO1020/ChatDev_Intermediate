# Slime Synthesis Application

Welcome to the Slime Synthesis Application! This software allows users to manage different sizes of slimes, synthesize them into larger sizes, and track the total number of slimes remaining after synthesis.

## Main Functions

- **Add Slime Sizes and Counts**: Users can input various sizes of slimes along with their respective counts.
- **Synthesize Slimes**: The application combines pairs of slimes of the same size to create larger slimes until no further synthesis can be performed.
- **Display Final Count**: After synthesis, the application displays the total number of slimes remaining.

## Installation

To run the Slime Synthesis Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your system PATH.

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. You can run the application directly without additional installations.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the application files are located, and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Slime Sizes**: When prompted, enter a positive integer representing the number of different slime sizes you want to input.

3. **Input Slime Sizes and Counts**: For each slime size, enter the size and count separated by a space. Ensure that the size is greater than or equal to 1 and the count is non-negative.

   Example input:
   ```
   1 5
   2 3
   ```

4. **Synthesis Process**: The application will automatically synthesize the slimes based on the input sizes and counts. It will combine pairs of slimes of the same size to create larger slimes.

5. **View Final Count**: After the synthesis process is complete, the application will display the final number of slimes remaining.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```
Enter the number of different slime sizes (positive integer): 2
Please enter the slime size (>= 1) and count (>= 0) separated by a space: 1 4
Please enter the slime size (>= 1) and count (>= 0) separated by a space: 2 2
Final number of slimes: 3
```

In this example, the user entered 2 different slime sizes. The application synthesized the slimes and displayed the final count.

## Conclusion

The Slime Synthesis Application is a fun and interactive way to manage slime sizes and synthesize them into larger sizes. We hope you enjoy using it! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out.
