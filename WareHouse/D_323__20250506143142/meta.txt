Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of different slime sizes. Initialize an empty dictionary 'slime_counts' to store the sizes and their corresponding counts. For each slime size from 1 to N, read the size 'S_i' and count 'C_i' from standard input and populate 'slime_counts' with 'slime_counts[S_i] = C_i'. Initialize a variable 'total_slimes' to the sum of all values in 'slime_counts', representing the initial number of slimes. Iterate over the 'slime_counts' dictionary to perform slime synthesis:\n   - For each size 'X' in 'slime_counts', while 'slime_counts[X]' is greater than or equal to 2:\n     - Calculate the number of new slimes created as 'new_slimes = slime_counts[X] // 2'.\n     - Update 'slime_counts[X]' to 'slime_counts[X] % 2' (remaining slimes after synthesis).\n     - Update or add 'slime_counts[2 * X]' with 'new_slimes'. After all possible syntheses, calculate the final number of slimes by summing the values in 'slime_counts'. Print the final number of slimes.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently manage the synthesis process while keeping track of the number of slimes at each size.
