# Card Flipper

A simple application to calculate the number of valid ways to flip cards based on their front and back values.

## Introduction

The Card Flipper application allows users to input a series of cards, each with a front and back value. The application then calculates the total number of valid configurations for flipping the cards based on the input values. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as card games or combinatorial problems.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the number of cards and their values are valid integers.
- **Card Representation**: Each card is represented by a class that holds its front and back values.
- **Configuration Calculation**: The application calculates the number of valid ways to flip the cards based on adjacent card values.

## Installation

To run the Card Flipper application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application requires no external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Card Flipper Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Number of Cards**: When prompted, enter the number of cards you wish to input. This must be a positive integer.

   ```
   Enter number of cards: 3
   ```

4. **Input Card Values**: For each card, you will be prompted to enter the front and back values separated by a space. For example:

   ```
   Enter front and back values for card 1 (separated by space): 1 2
   Enter front and back values for card 2 (separated by space): 2 3
   Enter front and back values for card 3 (separated by space): 3 1
   ```

5. **View Results**: After entering all card values, the application will calculate and display the total number of valid flips.

   ```
   Total valid flips: 4
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application.
2. Enter the number of cards: `4`
3. Enter the card values:
   - Card 1: `1 2`
   - Card 2: `2 3`
   - Card 3: `3 1`
   - Card 4: `1 4`
4. The application will output the total valid flips based on the entered values.

## Conclusion

The Card Flipper application is a straightforward tool for calculating valid card configurations. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or to add additional features. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
