Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of cards. Initialize two arrays, 'A' and 'B', of size N to store the values written on the front and back of each card, respectively. Read N pairs of integers from standard input and populate the arrays 'A[i]' and 'B[i]' for each card i (1 ≤ i ≤ N). Initialize a variable 'count' to store the number of valid ways to flip the cards, starting with the value 1. Iterate through the cards from 1 to N-1:\n   - For each pair of adjacent cards (i and i+1), check the values of 'A[i]', 'B[i]', 'A[i+1]', and 'B[i+1]'.\n   - Calculate the number of valid configurations for the current pair based on the values of the cards. Update the 'count' variable by multiplying it with the number of valid configurations for each pair, ensuring to take modulo '998244353' at each step to prevent overflow. After processing all pairs, the final value of 'count' will represent the total number of valid ways to flip the cards. Print the final value of 'count' as the output.
