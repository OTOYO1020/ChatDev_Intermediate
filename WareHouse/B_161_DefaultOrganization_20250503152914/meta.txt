Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input. Read the array A of length N, which contains the votes received by each item. Calculate the total number of votes 'total_votes' by summing all elements in A. Determine the minimum threshold for selection as 'threshold = total_votes / (4 * M)'. Initialize a counter 'selected_count' to zero to keep track of items that meet the selection criteria. Iterate through each vote count in A:\n   - For each 'A[i]', check if 'A[i]' is greater than or equal to 'threshold'.\n   - If true, increment 'selected_count'. After the iteration, check if 'selected_count' is greater than or equal to M. If yes, print 'Yes'; otherwise, print 'No'.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that all requirements of the problem are addressed in a structured manner, leading to a clear implementation plan.
