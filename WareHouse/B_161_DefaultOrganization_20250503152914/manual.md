# Voting Calculation Software

This software is designed to process voting data and determine if a certain number of items meet a specified threshold based on their votes. It reads input values, calculates totals, and outputs whether the selection criteria are met.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The software reads integers N (number of items) and M (minimum required items to be selected) from standard input.
2. **Vote Processing**: It reads an array of votes and calculates the total number of votes.
3. **Threshold Calculation**: It computes a threshold value to determine which items qualify based on their votes.
4. **Selection Criteria**: It counts how many items meet or exceed the threshold and checks if this count is at least M.
5. **Output**: The software outputs "Yes" if the selection criteria are met, otherwise "No".

## Installation

To run the software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
