# Triple Counter

A simple application to count valid triples (A, B, C) based on a given positive integer \( N \).

## Introduction

The Triple Counter application allows users to input a positive integer \( N \) and calculates the number of valid triples \( (A, B, C) \) that satisfy the following conditions:

- \( 1 \leq A \leq N^{1/3} \)
- \( A \leq B \leq N^{1/2} \)
- \( B \leq C \leq \lfloor N / (A \times B) \rfloor \)

This application is useful for mathematical computations and combinatorial problems.

## Quick Install

To run the Triple Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can clone the repository or download the files directly. Make sure you have the following files in your project directory:

- `main.py`
- `triple_counter.py`

## Environment Setup

No additional dependencies are required for this application, as it only uses built-in Python libraries. You can run the application directly after setting up the files.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the files are located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Positive Integer**:
   The application will prompt you to enter a positive integer \( N \). Type in your desired value and press Enter.

   ```
   Please enter a positive integer N: 
   ```

3. **View the Result**:
   After entering a valid positive integer, the application will calculate and display the count of valid triples:

   ```
   Count of valid triples: <count>
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   If you enter a non-positive integer or an invalid input, the application will prompt you to try again with a valid positive integer.

   ```
   Error: N must be a positive integer. Please try again.
   ```

## Example Usage

- If you input `8`, the application will calculate the valid triples for \( N = 8 \) and display the result.
- If you input `27`, it will calculate the valid triples for \( N = 27 \).

## Conclusion

The Triple Counter application is a straightforward tool for counting valid triples based on user-defined input. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for both educational and practical applications in mathematics.
