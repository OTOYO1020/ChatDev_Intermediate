# Apple Eating Simulation

A simple application to simulate the process of eating apples from baskets.

## Overview

This application allows users to input the number of baskets and the number of apples they wish to eat. The program will then simulate the process of eating apples from the baskets in a round-robin fashion until the desired number of apples has been eaten or until there are no apples left.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads integers for the number of baskets (N) and the number of apples to eat (K), as well as the array of apples in each basket.
- **Apple Eating Simulation**: The program simulates eating apples from the baskets, decrementing the count of apples in each basket until the specified number of apples has been eaten or all baskets are empty.
- **Output**: After the simulation, the program outputs the remaining number of apples in each basket.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system like Git, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies, you can install them using pip. For this application, there are no external dependencies required beyond Python itself.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the application using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - The number of baskets (N): Enter a positive integer greater than 0.
   - The number of apples to eat (K): Enter a non-negative integer.
   - The number of apples in each basket: Enter N space-separated integers representing the number of apples in each basket.

3. **View Results**: After entering the inputs, the application will simulate the eating process and display the remaining apples in each basket as a space-separated list.

## Example Usage

```
Input:
3
5
2 3 1

Output:
1 2 1
```

In this example, there are 3 baskets with 2, 3, and 1 apples respectively. The user wants to eat 5 apples. After the simulation, the output shows the remaining apples in each basket.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:
- If the number of baskets (N) is less than or equal to 0, an error message will be displayed.
- If the number of apples to eat (K) is negative, an error message will be displayed.
- If the number of apples provided does not match the number of baskets, an error message will be displayed.
- If K exceeds the total number of apples available, K will be adjusted to the total number of apples.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to simulate the process of eating apples from baskets. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or to add additional features!
