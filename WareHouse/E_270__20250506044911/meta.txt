Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input. Read the array A of size N, which contains the number of apples in each basket. Initialize a variable 'total_eaten' to 0 to keep track of the number of apples eaten. Initialize a variable 'current_basket' to 0 to represent the index of the current basket (starting from basket 1). While 'total_eaten' is less than K:\n   - Check if the current basket (A[current_basket]) has apples:\n     - If yes, decrement A[current_basket] by 1 and increment 'total_eaten' by 1.\n   - Move to the next basket by updating 'current_basket' to '(current_basket + 1) % N'. After exiting the loop, the array A will contain the remaining apples in each basket. Print the remaining apples in each basket in a single line, space-separated.
