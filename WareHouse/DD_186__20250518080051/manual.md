# Sum of Absolute Differences Calculator

This software provides a function to calculate the sum of absolute differences between pairs of integers. It is designed to handle large datasets efficiently and includes input validation to ensure correctness.

## Main Functions

- **calculate_sum_of_absolute_differences(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int**: 
  - This function takes an integer `N`, which represents the number of integers, and a list `A` of integers. It calculates the total sum of absolute differences for all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N.
  - The function optimizes the calculation by sorting the array first, avoiding a direct O(N^2) complexity.

## Installation

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the code:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

This project does not require any specific external packages, so you can run it with the standard Python library. However, it's a good practice to create a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

When prompted, enter the number of integers followed by the integers themselves, separated by spaces. For example:

```
Enter the number of integers followed by the integers separated by spaces: 5 -1 0 1 2 3
```

### Input Constraints

- `N` must be between 2 and 200,000.
- Each integer `A_i` must be within the range of -100,000,000 to 100,000,000.

The application will validate the input and provide error messages for any violations of these constraints.

## Testing

The software includes a set of test cases to validate the correctness of the function. You can uncomment the test function call in `calculator.py` to run the tests:

```python
# Uncomment the following line to run tests when this module is executed
# test_calculate_sum_of_absolute_differences()
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for invalid inputs. If the input does not meet the specified constraints, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

This software provides an efficient way to calculate the sum of absolute differences between pairs of integers, with built-in input validation and error handling. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
