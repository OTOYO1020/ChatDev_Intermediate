Task:
Define the function 'calculate_sum_of_absolute_differences(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of integers and A is the list of integers. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list of integers A from standard input. Ensure that the constraints are checked: N should be between 2 and 200,000, and each integer A_i should be within the range of -100,000,000 to 100,000,000. Create a nested loop structure to iterate over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N. Calculate the absolute difference |A[i] - A[j]| for each pair and maintain a running total of these differences. Optimize the calculation to avoid a direct O(N^2) complexity, possibly by sorting the array A first. Return the total sum of absolute differences from the function 'calculate_sum_of_absolute_differences'. Implement error handling for invalid inputs or constraints violations. Write test cases to validate the correctness of the function with various edge cases. Output the final result as an integer representing the sum of absolute differences.
