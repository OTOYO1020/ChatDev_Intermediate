Task:
Define the function 'min_connected_components(N: int, M: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int' to handle the input format, where 'N' is the number of vertices, 'M' is the number of edges, and 'edges' is a list of tuples representing the edges between vertices. Parse the input to extract the values of 'N', 'M', and the list of edges 'edges' from the input format. Create a representation of the graph using an adjacency list or adjacency matrix based on the edges provided. Implement a function to check if a given set of edges maintains the condition that for every pair of vertices in the same connected component, there is a direct edge connecting them. Generate all possible subsets of edges to explore different configurations of the graph after edge removals. For each subset of edges, use the function from subtask 4 to determine if the condition is satisfied and count the number of connected components. Keep track of the minimum number of connected components found across all valid configurations of edges. Return the minimum number of connected components as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when there are no edges or when all vertices are isolated. Format the output as an integer representing the minimum number of connected components.
