# Minimum Connected Components Calculator

A Python application to calculate the minimum number of connected components in a graph based on user-defined edges.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a graph defined by its vertices and edges, and it calculates the minimum number of connected components that can be formed by exploring different configurations of the graph after edge removals. 

## Main Functions

- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list for efficient traversal and manipulation.
- **Edge Validation**: The application checks if a given set of edges maintains the condition that for every pair of vertices in the same connected component, there is a direct edge connecting them.
- **Connected Components Calculation**: The software generates all possible subsets of edges and counts the number of connected components for each valid configuration.
- **Minimum Components Output**: It returns the minimum number of connected components found across all valid configurations.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install any required dependencies using pip. If there are no specific dependencies listed, the application should work with standard Python libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the number of vertices followed by the edges. The input should be formatted as follows:
   ```
   N
   u1 v1
   u2 v2
   ...
   ```
   Where `N` is the number of vertices, and each line after that represents an edge between two vertices `u` and `v`.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   0 1
   1 2
   3 4
   ```

3. **Output**: The application will calculate and print the minimum number of connected components based on the provided edges.

## Edge Cases

- If there are no vertices (`N = 0`), the output will be `0`.
- If there are vertices but no edges, each vertex will be its own component, and the output will be equal to `N`.

## Support

For any issues or questions regarding the application, please contact the support team or refer to the documentation for further assistance.
