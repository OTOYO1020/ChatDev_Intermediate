Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input, followed by M pairs of integers (A_i, B_i) representing the adjacent gem pairs. Read integer K from standard input, followed by K integers (C_1, C_2, ..., C_K) representing the required gem types. Construct an undirected graph where each gem type is a node, and an edge exists between nodes A_i and B_i if those gems can be adjacent. Use a graph traversal algorithm (e.g., BFS or DFS) to identify connected components in the graph. For each connected component, check if it contains all required gem types C_1, C_2, ..., C_K. If all required gem types are found in at least one connected component, determine the minimum number of gems needed to form a valid sequence. If it is possible to form such a sequence, store the minimum number of gems needed; otherwise, indicate that it is not possible. Implement a function 'is_possible_and_minimum_gems(graph, required_gems)' to encapsulate the logic for checking the possibility and calculating the minimum gems. Print the result: the minimum number of gems needed if possible, or indicate impossibility if not. Ensure that the output format is clear and concise, adhering to the problem's requirements.
