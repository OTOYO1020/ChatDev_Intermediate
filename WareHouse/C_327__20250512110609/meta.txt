Task:
Define the function 'is_valid_sudoku(grid: List[List[int]]) -> str' to check if the given 9x9 grid satisfies the Sudoku conditions. Implement input handling to read a 9x9 grid of integers from standard input, ensuring each integer is between 1 and 9. Create a helper function 'check_rows(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool' to verify that each row contains the integers 1 to 9 exactly once. Create a helper function 'check_columns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool' to verify that each column contains the integers 1 to 9 exactly once. Create a helper function 'check_subgrids(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool' to verify that each 3x3 subgrid contains the integers 1 to 9 exactly once. In the 'is_valid_sudoku' function, call 'check_rows' and return False if any row check fails. In the 'is_valid_sudoku' function, call 'check_columns' and return False if any column check fails. In the 'is_valid_sudoku' function, call 'check_subgrids' and return False if any subgrid check fails. If all checks pass, return 'Yes' from the 'is_valid_sudoku' function; otherwise, return 'No'. Print the output of the 'is_valid_sudoku' function after processing the input grid.
