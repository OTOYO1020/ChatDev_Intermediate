# 1122 Sequence Finder

A Python application to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that is a 1122 sequence.

## What is a 1122 Sequence?

A 1122 sequence is defined as a contiguous subarray where:
- The length of the subarray is even.
- Every integer appears either not at all or exactly twice.
- Pairs of integers are equal.

## Main Functions

The application consists of two main components:
1. **Main Application (`main.py`)**: This is the entry point of the application where user input is read and the maximum length of the 1122 sequence is calculated.
2. **Helper Functions (`helpers.py`)**: This module contains the logic to find the maximum length of the 1122 sequence based on the provided sequence of integers.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   You may need to install any required dependencies. If there are no specific dependencies mentioned, you can run the application directly with Python.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Sequence**:
   When prompted, enter a sequence of positive integers separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter the sequence of positive integers (space-separated): 1 1 2 2 3 3
   ```

3. **View the Result**:
   After entering the sequence, the application will calculate and display the maximum length of the 1122 sequence:
   ```
   Max Length of 1122 Sequence: 6
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input a sequence:
   ```
   Enter the sequence of positive integers (space-separated): 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   Max Length of 1122 Sequence: 8
   ```

## Error Handling

If you enter an invalid sequence (e.g., non-integer values), the application will prompt you with an error message:
```
Please enter a valid sequence of integers.
```

## Conclusion

The 1122 Sequence Finder is a simple yet powerful tool to analyze sequences of integers and identify the maximum length of valid 1122 sequences. Feel free to modify the code and enhance its functionality as per your requirements.
