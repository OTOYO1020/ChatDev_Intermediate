# Transformation Application

A Python application for performing element transformations based on user-defined rules.

## Overview

The Transformation application allows users to define a set of transformation rules for combinations of elements. By inputting a matrix of transformation values, users can compute the final element obtained after a series of transformations. This application is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear error messages for invalid inputs.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Transformation Values**: Users can input a matrix of transformation values that dictate how elements combine.
2. **Calculate Final Element**: The application processes the transformation rules and computes the final element based on the defined logic.
3. **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling to ensure that inputs are valid and provide feedback for corrections.

## Installation

To run the Transformation application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application requires no additional dependencies beyond the standard Python library. However, it is recommended to use Python 3.6 or higher.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Number of Element Types (N)**: When prompted, enter an integer value representing the number of element types.

   ```
   Enter number of element types (N): 3
   ```

4. **Input Transformation Values**: You will be prompted to enter the transformation values for each row of the matrix. Each row should contain exactly N values, separated by spaces.

   ```
   Please enter the transformation values for each row, separated by spaces (e.g., '1 2 3 ...'):
   1 2 3
   2 1 3
   3 2 1
   ```

5. **View the Result**: After entering the transformation values, the application will compute and display the final element.

   ```
   Final Element: 2
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the number of values in a row does not match N, an error message will prompt the user to re-enter the row.
- If any transformation value is outside the range of 1 to N, an error message will indicate the invalid input.
- If the total number of rows does not equal N, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Transformation application is a powerful tool for performing element transformations based on user-defined rules. With its clear interface and robust error handling, users can easily input their transformation matrices and compute the final results.
