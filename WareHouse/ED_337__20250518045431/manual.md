# Juice Bottle Spoilage Identification Software

This software is designed to help identify a spoiled juice bottle among a given number of bottles using a minimal number of friends to taste them. It employs a systematic approach based on binary representation to efficiently determine the spoiled bottle.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the total number of juice bottles from standard input.
- **Friend Distribution**: Calculates the minimum number of friends required to identify the spoiled bottle and distributes the bottles among them.
- **Response Analysis**: Receives a response string indicating which friends experienced an upset stomach and deduces the possible spoiled bottle(s).
- **Output**: Prints the identified spoiled bottle number or an error message if it cannot be uniquely identified.

## Installation

To run this software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This software does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. You can run the code directly without additional installations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the software files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python. You can do this from the command line.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Number of Bottles**:
   When prompted, enter the total number of juice bottles (N). This should be a positive integer.

   ```
   8
   ```

4. **Receive the Response**:
   After the friends have tasted the bottles, you will need to input the response string (S) indicating which friends experienced an upset stomach. The string should consist of '0's and '1's, where '1' indicates an upset stomach.

   ```
   101
   ```

5. **Output**:
   The program will output the number of friends used, the distribution of bottles among them, and finally, the identified spoiled bottle number (X').

   ```
   3
   4 1 2 3 4
   2 5 6
   2 7 8
   5
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to use the software:

1. Start the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the number of bottles:
   ```
   8
   ```

3. Input the response string:
   ```
   101
   ```

4. Output will be:
   ```
   3
   4 1 2 3 4
   2 5 6
   2 7 8
   5
   ```

## Error Handling

- If you input a non-positive integer for the number of bottles, the program will display an error message.
- If the response string length does not match the number of friends, a warning will be printed.

## Conclusion

This software provides an efficient way to identify spoiled juice bottles using a systematic approach. By leveraging the binary representation of bottle IDs, it minimizes the number of friends needed for testing, ensuring quick and accurate identification of the spoiled bottle.
