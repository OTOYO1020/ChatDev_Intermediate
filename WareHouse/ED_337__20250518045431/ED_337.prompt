Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of juice bottles. Determine the minimum number of friends M needed to identify the spoiled bottle. For each friend i from 1 to M, decide how many bottles K_i to serve and which bottles A_{i, 1}, A_{i, 2}, ..., A_{i, K_i} to serve, ensuring they are in ascending order. Print the number of friends M followed by the distribution of bottles for each friend in the specified format. Receive the string S from the judge, which indicates whether each friend has an upset stomach (1 for upset, 0 for not). Analyze the string S to determine which friend(s) experienced an upset stomach and deduce the possible spoiled bottle(s). Identify the spoiled bottle number X' based on the analysis of S. Print the identified spoiled bottle number X' to standard output. Ensure all outputs end with a newline and flush the standard output to avoid TLE. Terminate the program immediately after printing X'.
