Read integers A, B, and K from standard input, representing the number of cookies Takahashi has, the number of cookies Aoki has, and the number of actions to perform, respectively. Initialize variables 'takahashi_cookies' with A and 'aoki_cookies' with B. Loop K times to simulate the actions:\n   - If 'takahashi_cookies' > 0, decrement 'takahashi_cookies' by 1.\n   - Else if 'aoki_cookies' > 0, decrement 'aoki_cookies' by 1.\n   - If both are 0, do nothing. After completing the loop, the final values of 'takahashi_cookies' and 'aoki_cookies' will represent the remaining cookies. Print the final counts of cookies for Takahashi and Aoki, respectively.
