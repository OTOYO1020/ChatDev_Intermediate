Task:
Parse the input to extract the number of vertices N, number of edges M, and the list of edges (U_i, V_i) along with the values A_v for each vertex. Construct the graph representation using an adjacency list or similar data structure based on the edges provided. Implement a function to perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all simple paths from vertex 1 to vertex N. During the path exploration, maintain a sequence S of integers corresponding to the vertices visited along the path. Check if the sequence S is non-decreasing; if it is not, assign a score of 0 for that path. If S is non-decreasing, calculate the score as the number of distinct integers in S. Keep track of the maximum score encountered during the exploration of all paths from vertex 1 to vertex N. Handle cases where no valid path exists by ensuring the graph is connected as per the problem constraints. Define the function 'find_max_score_path(N, M, edges, values)' to encapsulate the logic for finding the maximum score path. Output the maximum score found after exploring all paths from vertex 1 to vertex N.
