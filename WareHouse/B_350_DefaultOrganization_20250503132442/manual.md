# Teeth Treatment Application

Manage your dental health with the Teeth Treatment application. This software allows you to simulate the treatment of teeth, toggling their presence based on user input.

## Main Functions

The Teeth Treatment application provides the following main functionalities:

- **Initialize Teeth**: Start with a specified number of teeth, all set to present.
- **Treat Teeth**: Toggle the state of a tooth (present or absent) based on user input.
- **Count Remaining Teeth**: After all treatments, count how many teeth are still present.
- **Input Validation**: The application includes robust input validation, allowing users to retry if they enter invalid indices.

## Installation

To run the Teeth Treatment application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   You can install the required dependencies using pip. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (if not already provided):
   ```
   # No external dependencies required for this application
   ```

   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer to leave it empty, you can skip this step.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Teeth and Treatments**:
   - When prompted, enter the total number of teeth (N).
   - Next, enter the number of treatments (Q).

3. **Perform Treatments**:
   For each treatment, you will be prompted to enter the index of the tooth you wish to treat:
   - Enter a number between 1 and N (inclusive). The application will toggle the state of the specified tooth.
   - If you enter an invalid index, you will have up to 3 attempts to provide a valid input. If you fail to do so, the treatment will be skipped.

4. **View Results**:
   After all treatments are processed, the application will display:
   - The total number of remaining teeth.
   - The number of successfully completed treatments.
   - The number of attempted treatments.
   - The number of treatments that were skipped due to invalid input.

## Example Usage

```
Input:
5
3
1
2
6

Output:
3
Successfully completed 2 treatments.
Attempted 3 treatments in total.
Skipped 1 treatments due to invalid input.
```

In this example, the user started with 5 teeth and attempted 3 treatments. The user successfully toggled the state of two teeth and skipped one treatment due to an invalid index.

## Conclusion

The Teeth Treatment application is a simple yet effective way to manage and simulate dental treatments. With its user-friendly interface and input validation, it ensures a smooth experience for users. Enjoy managing your teeth!
