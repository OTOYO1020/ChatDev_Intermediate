Read integers N and Q from standard input, representing the number of teeth and the number of treatments. Initialize a list 'teeth' of size N with all elements set to 'True', indicating that each hole initially contains a tooth. For each treatment from 1 to Q:\n   - Read the integer T_i from standard input, representing the hole being treated.\n   - If 'teeth[T_i - 1]' is 'True' (indicating a tooth is present), set 'teeth[T_i - 1]' to 'False' (remove the tooth).\n   - If 'teeth[T_i - 1]' is 'False' (indicating the hole is empty), set 'teeth[T_i - 1]' to 'True' (grow a tooth). Count the number of 'True' values in the 'teeth' list to determine how many teeth remain after all treatments. Print the final count of teeth.
