Task:
Receive three strings 'S1', 'S2', and 'S3' from standard input, representing the series of contests currently held by AtCoder. Initialize a set 'held_series' containing the four series: '{'ABC', 'ARC', 'AGC', 'AHC'}'. Create a list 'input_series' containing the values of 'S1', 'S2', and 'S3'. Remove the elements in 'input_series' from the 'held_series' set to find the remaining series. Convert the remaining series in 'held_series' to a list 'remaining_series'. If 'remaining_series' is empty, prepare a result string indicating 'No additional series'. Otherwise, join the elements of 'remaining_series' into a single string separated by commas. Print the result string.\n\nOutput format: The output will be a string listing the series of contests currently held by AtCoder in addition to 'S1', 'S2', and 'S3', or a message indicating no additional series.
