Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the sequence. Read the sequence C of N integers from standard input. Initialize a variable 'result' to 1 to store the count of valid sequences. Iterate over each index i from 0 to N-1:\n   - For each i, calculate the number of valid choices for A[i] as 'choices = C[i] - i'.\n   - If 'choices <= 0', print 0 and exit, as it means there are no valid sequences.\n   - Update 'result' by multiplying it with 'choices' and taking modulo '(10^9 + 7)'. Print the final value of 'result' as the output.
