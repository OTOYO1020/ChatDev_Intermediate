# Valid Sequence Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of valid sequences based on user-provided input.

## Introduction

The Valid Sequence Calculator reads an integer N, which represents the length of a sequence, and a sequence C of N integers. It calculates the number of valid sequences based on the provided criteria. The application ensures that the input is valid and computes the result efficiently.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the length of the sequence matches the expected value and that all elements are non-negative integers.
- **Calculation of Valid Sequences**: Iterates through the sequence to compute the number of valid choices for each index and updates the result accordingly.
- **Output**: Displays the final count of valid sequences or indicates if no valid sequences are possible.

## Installation

To run the Valid Sequence Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   There are no additional packages required for this project. You can create a virtual environment and activate it if desired:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **No Additional Packages Needed**:
   The `requirements.txt` file is empty, indicating that no external libraries are required for the current implementation.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Length of the Sequence**:
   When prompted, enter a positive integer N, which represents the length of the sequence.

3. **Input the Sequence**:
   Enter N integers separated by spaces. Ensure that all integers are non-negative.

4. **View the Result**:
   The application will compute and display the number of valid sequences based on the input provided. If there are no valid sequences, it will output `0`.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the length of the sequence (N): 5
Enter 5 integers separated by spaces: 5 4 3 2 1
Output: 0
```

```plaintext
Enter the length of the sequence (N): 3
Enter 3 integers separated by spaces: 3 3 3
Output: 6
```

## Conclusion

The Valid Sequence Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating valid sequences based on user input. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, ensuring that users can easily obtain results with minimal setup.
