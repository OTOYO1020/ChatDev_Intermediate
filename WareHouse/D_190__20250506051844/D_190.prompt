Read the integer value N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to keep track of the number of valid arithmetic progressions. Iterate over possible starting values 'a' from 1 to N:\n   - For each 'a', calculate the maximum number of terms 'k' such that the sum of the arithmetic progression is equal to N. For each starting value 'a', check if the sum of the arithmetic progression can equal N:\n   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression: \( S = \frac{k}{2} \times (2a + (k - 1) \times 1) \).\n   - Rearrange to find if there exists a valid integer k such that \( N = \frac{k}{2} \times (2a + (k - 1)) \). If a valid k is found for a given a, increment the 'count'. Continue this process until all possible starting values 'a' have been checked. Print the final value of 'count', which represents the number of valid arithmetic progressions.
