# Arithmetic Progression Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of valid arithmetic progressions that sum to a given integer N.

## Main Functions

The Arithmetic Progression Calculator provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads a positive integer N from the user.
- **Calculation of Valid Progressions**: Computes the number of valid arithmetic progressions that sum to N using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression.
- **Output**: Displays the total count of valid arithmetic progressions to the user.

## Installation

To run the Arithmetic Progression Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   The current implementation does not require any external libraries, as it uses built-in Python functionality. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   After running the command above, the application will prompt you to enter a positive integer N.

2. **Input a Positive Integer**:
   Type a positive integer (greater than zero) and press Enter. For example:
   ```
   Enter a positive integer N to calculate valid arithmetic progressions: 10
   ```

3. **View the Result**:
   The application will calculate and display the number of valid arithmetic progressions that sum to the entered value of N. For example:
   ```
   Number of valid arithmetic progressions: 2
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If you enter a non-integer value, the application will prompt you to enter a valid integer.
   - If you enter a non-positive integer, the application will ask you to enter a positive integer greater than zero.

## Example Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input:
   ```
   Enter a positive integer N to calculate valid arithmetic progressions: 15
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   Number of valid arithmetic progressions: 3
   ```

## Conclusion

The Arithmetic Progression Calculator is a straightforward tool designed to help users find valid arithmetic progressions for a given integer N. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can easily set up and run the application to explore arithmetic progressions.
