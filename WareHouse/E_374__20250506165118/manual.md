# Production Capacity Calculator

A tool for calculating the maximum achievable production capacity based on machine processing capacities and costs.

## Quick Install

To get started with the Production Capacity Calculator, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The code is compatible with Python 3.x.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Production Capacity Calculator allows users to input the number of processes, their respective machine processing capacities, costs, and a total budget. The software then computes the maximum achievable production capacity based on the provided inputs.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Data**: 
   - Enter the number of processes (N).
   - For each process, input the machine processing capacities (A_i, B_i) and their respective costs (P_i, Q_i).
   - Enter the total budget (X).

2. **Calculate Maximum Capacity**: 
   - The software calculates the maximum production capacity that can be achieved within the given budget by determining the optimal number of machines to purchase for each process.

3. **Output Result**: 
   - The software outputs the maximum achievable production capacity based on the inputs provided.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Processes**:
   - When prompted, enter the integer value for the number of processes (N).

3. **Input Machine Capacities and Costs**:
   - For each process, you will be prompted to enter the values for A_i, B_i, P_i, and Q_i. Input these values as space-separated integers. For example:
   ```
   Enter A_1, B_1, P_1, Q_1 (space-separated): 10 20 5 3
   ```

4. **Input Total Budget**:
   - After entering all process data, you will be prompted to enter the total budget (X):
   ```
   Enter the total budget X: 100
   ```

5. **View the Result**:
   - The application will calculate and display the maximum achievable production capacity:
   ```
   The maximum achievable production capacity is: 200
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the input might look:

```
Enter the number of processes: 2
Enter A_1, B_1, P_1, Q_1 (space-separated): 10 20 5 3
Enter A_2, B_2, P_2, Q_2 (space-separated): 15 25 7 4
Enter the total budget X: 50
The maximum achievable production capacity is: 300
```
