Task:
Read the dimensions of the grid, H and W, from standard input. Initialize a 2D list 'A' of size H x W to store the first set of numbers and a 2D list 'B' of size H x W for the second set of numbers. Populate the lists 'A' and 'B' by reading the values for each square (A_{ij}, B_{ij}) from standard input. Define a function 'calculate_unbalancedness(path)' that takes a list of tuples representing the path and calculates the unbalancedness based on the sums of red and blue numbers. Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., dynamic programming or depth-first search) to explore all possible paths from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (H, W). For each path, determine the optimal painting (red or blue) for each square to minimize unbalancedness. Keep track of the minimum unbalancedness found across all paths. Print the minimum unbalancedness as the final result.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output should be a single integer representing the minimum unbalancedness.
