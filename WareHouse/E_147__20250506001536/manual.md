# Minimum Unbalancedness Calculator

A Python application for calculating the minimum unbalancedness in a grid of numbers.

## Overview

This application reads a grid of numbers from standard input, calculates the unbalancedness based on two sets of numbers (red and blue), and finds the optimal path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. The goal is to minimize the difference between the sums of the red and blue numbers along the path.

## Main Functions

- **Input Dimensions**: The application prompts the user to enter the dimensions of the grid (height H and width W).
- **Input Values**: Users can input two sets of values for the grid, one for red values (grid A) and one for blue values (grid B).
- **Calculate Unbalancedness**: The application computes the unbalancedness based on the sums of red and blue numbers along the path.
- **Pathfinding**: It implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths and determine the minimum unbalancedness.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the height (H) and width (W) of the grid, separated by a space. For example:

   ```
   Enter height (H) and width (W): 3 3
   ```

3. **Input Grid Values**: You will then be prompted to enter the values for grid A (red values) and grid B (blue values). Enter the values row by row. For example:

   ```
   Enter grid A values (row by row):
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9

   Enter grid B values (row by row):
   9 8 7
   6 5 4
   3 2 1
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the minimum unbalancedness:

   ```
   Minimum Unbalancedness: <result>
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how the input and output might look:

```
Enter height (H) and width (W): 2 2
Enter grid A values (row by row):
1 2
3 4
Enter grid B values (row by row):
4 3
2 1
Minimum Unbalancedness: 0
```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to calculate the minimum unbalancedness in a grid of numbers. For any issues or questions, please refer to the documentation or contact support.
