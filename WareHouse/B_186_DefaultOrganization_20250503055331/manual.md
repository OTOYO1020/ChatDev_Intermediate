# Block Grid Application

A simple application for managing a grid of blocks, allowing users to equalize the number of blocks in each square by calculating the minimum number of blocks to remove.

## Main Functions

- **Input Grid Dimensions**: Users can specify the number of rows (H) and columns (W) for the grid.
- **Input Block Values**: Users can enter the number of blocks for each square in the grid.
- **Calculate Minimum Blocks to Remove**: The application computes how many blocks need to be removed to ensure all squares have the same number of blocks.

## Installation

To run the Block Grid Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not have any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Grid Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the number of rows (H) and columns (W) for the grid.
   ```
   Enter number of rows (H): 3
   Enter number of columns (W): 4
   ```

4. **Input the Block Values**: For each row, enter the number of blocks in each square, separated by spaces. Ensure you enter the correct number of values as specified by the number of columns.
   ```
   Enter the values for each square in the grid (space-separated non-negative integers).
   Row 1: 2 4 1 3
   Row 2: 5 0 2 1
   Row 3: 3 3 3 3
   ```

5. **View the Result**: After entering all values, the application will calculate and display the minimum number of blocks that need to be removed to equalize the number of blocks in each square.
   ```
   Minimum blocks to remove: 6
   ```

## Error Handling

- If you enter invalid integers for H or W, the application will prompt you to enter valid integers.
- If the input for the grid values is empty or does not match the specified dimensions, the application will ask you to re-enter the values.
- The application ensures that all block values are non-negative integers.

## Conclusion

The Block Grid Application is a straightforward tool for managing and equalizing blocks in a grid format. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting data and calculating results, making it easy for users to achieve their desired outcomes.
