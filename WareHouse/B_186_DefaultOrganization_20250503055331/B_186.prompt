Read the integers H and W from standard input, representing the number of horizontal rows and vertical columns of the grid. Initialize a 2D list 'A' of size H x W to store the number of blocks in each square. Populate the 2D list 'A' by reading the values for each square from standard input. Calculate the total number of blocks in the grid by summing all elements in 'A'. Determine the target number of blocks per square, which is the average of the total blocks divided by H * W, rounded down (using integer division). Initialize a variable 'blocks_to_remove' to zero to keep track of the total number of blocks that need to be removed. Iterate through each element in the 2D list 'A' and for each square, calculate how many blocks need to be removed to reach the target number of blocks. Accumulate the total number of blocks to be removed in 'blocks_to_remove'. Print the value of 'blocks_to_remove', which represents the minimum number of blocks that must be removed to make all squares have the same number of blocks.
