# Fuse Meeting Point Calculator

The Fuse Meeting Point Calculator is a Python application designed to calculate the meeting point of flames from two ends of a series of fuses based on their lengths and burn speeds. This tool is useful for simulations and experiments involving combustion and timing.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of fuses and their respective lengths and burn speeds from standard input.
- **Fuse Calculation**: It calculates the time taken for flames to meet from both ends and determines the exact meeting point.
- **Output**: The application outputs the distance from the left end to the meeting point as a single integer.

## Installation

To run the Fuse Meeting Point Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. You can run the application directly without additional installations.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the application using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: The application will prompt you to enter the number of fuses (N). After that, you will need to input N pairs of integers representing the lengths and burn speeds of the fuses. For example:
   ```
   3
   10 2
   20 4
   30 6
   ```

3. **View Output**: After entering the data, the application will calculate the meeting point and print the distance from the left end to the meeting point.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
3
10 2
20 4
30 6
```

**Output:**
```
25
```

This output indicates that the flames from both ends meet at a distance of 25 units from the left end.

## Conclusion

The Fuse Meeting Point Calculator is a straightforward and efficient tool for calculating the meeting point of flames in a series of fuses. It is designed for ease of use and can be integrated into larger simulations or experiments involving combustion dynamics.
