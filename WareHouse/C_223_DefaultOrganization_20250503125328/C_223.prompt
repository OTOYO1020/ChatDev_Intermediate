Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of fuses. Initialize two lists, 'A' and 'B', to store the lengths and burn speeds of the fuses respectively. Read N pairs of integers from standard input and populate the lists 'A' and 'B' with the lengths and burn speeds of the fuses. Initialize two variables, 'left_time' and 'right_time', to track the time taken for flames to reach the meeting point from the left and right ends. Loop through the fuses from the left to calculate the cumulative burn time until the flame reaches the meeting point:\n   - Update 'left_time' by adding the time taken for each fuse based on its length and burn speed. Loop through the fuses from the right to calculate the cumulative burn time until the flame reaches the meeting point:\n   - Update 'right_time' similarly, but in reverse order. Determine the meeting point by comparing 'left_time' and 'right_time':\n   - If 'left_time' is less than 'right_time', calculate the position of the meeting point from the left end.\n   - If 'right_time' is less than 'left_time', calculate the position of the meeting point from the right end.\n   - If both times are equal, the meeting point is at the end of the last fuse. Calculate the distance from the left end to the meeting point. Print the calculated distance as the output.\n\nOutput format: The output should be a single integer representing the distance from the left end of the object to the meeting point of the flames.
