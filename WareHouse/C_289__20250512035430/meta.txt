Task:
Define the function 'count_valid_sets(M: int, N: int, sets: List[List[int]]) -> int' to handle the input parameters, where 'M' is the number of sets, 'N' is the maximum integer value, and 'sets' is a list of lists containing the integers in each set. Parse the input to extract the values of 'M', 'N', and the list of sets 'S' from the input format. Initialize a variable 'valid_count' to zero to keep track of the number of valid combinations of sets. Generate all possible combinations of the sets using a loop that iterates from 1 to (2^M - 1) to represent all non-empty subsets. For each combination of sets, create a set 'covered' to track which integers from 1 to N are covered by the chosen sets. For each integer 'x' from 1 to N, check if it is present in the 'covered' set; if all integers are covered, increment 'valid_count'. Return the value of 'valid_count' as the result of the function. Ensure that the input constraints are respected, specifically that '1 <= N <= 10', '1 <= M <= 10', and '1 <= C_i <= N'. Handle any potential edge cases, such as when no sets are chosen or when all integers are covered by the chosen sets. Output the result in the format of a single integer representing the count of valid combinations.
