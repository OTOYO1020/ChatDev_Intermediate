# Count Valid Sets

A Python application to count valid combinations of sets that cover all integers from 1 to N.

## Overview

This software defines a function `count_valid_sets(M: int, N: int, sets: List[List[int]]) -> int` that takes the number of sets, the maximum integer value, and a list of sets. It calculates how many non-empty combinations of these sets cover all integers from 1 to N.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to input the number of sets (M), the maximum integer value (N), and the integers in each set.
- **Count Valid Sets**: The core logic iterates through all possible combinations of the sets to determine how many combinations cover all integers from 1 to N.
- **Output**: The result is printed as a single integer representing the count of valid combinations.

## Installation

To run this application, you need Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   This application does not require any external libraries, so you can run it directly with Python. If you want to create a virtual environment, you can do so with the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Input the Number of Sets (M)**: When prompted, enter the number of sets you want to provide.
2. **Input the Maximum Integer Value (N)**: Enter the maximum integer value that should be covered by the sets.
3. **Input the Sets**: For each set, enter the integers as a comma-separated list. Ensure that all integers are between 1 and N.
   - Example input for Set 1: `1,2,3`
   - Example input for Set 2: `2,3,4`
4. **View the Result**: After entering all sets, the application will calculate and display the count of valid combinations that cover all integers from 1 to N.

## Example

```
Enter the number of sets (M): 2
Enter the maximum integer value (N): 4
Enter integers for set 1 (comma-separated): 1,2
Enter integers for set 2 (comma-separated): 3,4
```

**Output**:
```
2
```

This indicates that there are 2 valid combinations of the provided sets that cover all integers from 1 to 4.

## Notes

- Ensure that the input values respect the constraints: `1 <= N <= 10`, `1 <= M <= 10`, and `1 <= C_i <= N`.
- The application will raise errors if the input values do not meet these constraints.
