Read integers H, W, X, Y from standard input, representing the grid dimensions and Santa's starting position. Read the grid representation S, which consists of H strings of length W, indicating impassable cells ('#'), passable cells without houses ('.'), and passable cells with houses ('@'). Initialize a set 'houses_visited' to keep track of distinct houses Santa visits. Set Santa's initial position to '(X, Y)' in a variable 'current_position'. Iterate over each character in the string T, which represents Santa's movement commands:\n   - For each command:\n     - Determine the new position based on the command ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').\n     - Check if the new position is passable:\n       - If passable and contains a house ('@'), add the house's coordinates to 'houses_visited'.\n       - Update 'current_position' to the new position if it is passable. After processing all commands, determine the final position of Santa. Calculate the number of distinct houses visited by taking the length of the 'houses_visited' set. Print the final position of Santa and the count of distinct houses visited.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all requirements of the problem are met while maintaining clarity and organization in the implementation.
