# Ball Counting Software

A simple application to count the number of balls remaining after each insertion based on their occurrences.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this software is to track the number of balls remaining after each insertion. When a ball's count reaches 2, all instances of that ball disappear. The software provides a clear output of the total number of balls remaining after each insertion.

### Key Features:
- Count the occurrences of each ball.
- Automatically remove balls when their count reaches 2.
- Provide a list of remaining balls after each insertion.

## Installation

To run the ball counting software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**: This software uses standard libraries, so no additional dependencies are required. However, ensure you have the following:
   - `typing` (comes with Python 3.5+)

3. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:

   ```

4. **Run the Application**: You can run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the number of balls followed by the integers on the balls, separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter the number of balls followed by the integers on the balls (space-separated): 5 1 2 1 2 3
   ```

2. **Output**: After entering the input, the program will process the data and output the results, showing the number of balls remaining after each insertion. For example:
   ```
   Results: [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: If the number of balls does not match the provided count, the program will raise an error:
   ```
   Input Error: The number of balls does not match the provided count.
   ```
