Define the function 'count_balls_after_insertion(N: int, a: List[int]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of balls and a is the list of integers on the balls. Initialize a list 'result' to store the number of balls after each insertion. Create a dictionary 'count' to keep track of the occurrences of each integer on the balls. Iterate through the list 'a' using a loop from 0 to N-1 to process each ball insertion. For each ball 'a[i]', increment its count in the 'count' dictionary. Check if the count of 'a[i]' is greater than or equal to '2'. If so, calculate how many balls should disappear based on the count. Update the total number of balls by subtracting the number of disappearing balls from the current total. Append the current total number of balls to the 'result' list after each insertion. Return the 'result' list after processing all balls to provide the final counts. Ensure the output format is a list of integers representing the number of balls remaining after each insertion.
