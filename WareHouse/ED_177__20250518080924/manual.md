# Coprime Checker

A utility for checking the coprimality of a list of integers.

## Overview

The Coprime Checker application provides two main functionalities:
1. **Pairwise Coprimality Check**: Determines if all integers in a list are pairwise coprime.
2. **GCD Calculation**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers.

## Main Functions

### 1. `is_pairwise_coprime(A)`

- **Description**: Checks if all integers in the list `A` are pairwise coprime by calculating the GCD for every pair of integers.
- **Input**: A list of integers.
- **Output**: Returns `True` if the integers are pairwise coprime, otherwise returns `False`.

### 2. `gcd_of_list(A)`

- **Description**: Computes the GCD of the entire list `A` using an iterative approach.
- **Input**: A list of integers.
- **Output**: Returns the GCD of the integers in the list.

## Installation

To run the Coprime Checker application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Coprime Checker application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Integers**: When prompted, enter the number of integers (N). Ensure that `N` is between 2 and 10^6.

3. **Input the List of Integers**: Enter the integers as space-separated values. Each integer must be between 1 and 10^6.

4. **Output**: The application will check for pairwise coprimality and print one of the following results:
   - `pairwise coprime`: If all integers are pairwise coprime.
   - `setwise coprime`: If the integers are not pairwise coprime but their overall GCD is 1.
   - `neither`: If the integers are neither pairwise coprime nor setwise coprime.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter the number of integers (N): 5
Enter 5 integers (space-separated): 3 5 7 11 13
pairwise coprime
```

```plaintext
Enter the number of integers (N): 4
Enter 4 integers (space-separated): 4 6 8 10
neither
```

## Testing

The application has been tested with various edge cases to ensure correctness and performance. You can further test it by providing different sets of integers within the specified constraints.

## Support

For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team or raise an issue in the repository.
