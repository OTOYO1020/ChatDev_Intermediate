# Triangle Counting Graph Application

This application allows users to input a graph defined by vertices and edges, and counts the number of triangles formed by the vertices in the graph. A triangle is defined as a set of three distinct vertices where each pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

## Main Functions

- **Input Graph Data**: Users can input the number of vertices (N) and edges (M), followed by M pairs of integers representing the edges of the graph.
- **Count Triangles**: The application computes the number of triangles in the graph based on the edges provided.
- **Output Result**: The final count of triangles is printed to the standard output.

## Installation Instructions

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (if any dependencies are needed in the future):
   ```
   # Add any required packages here
   ```

   Then install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the number of vertices (N) and edges (M) followed by M pairs of integers representing the edges. For example:
   ```
   5 6
   1 2
   2 3
   3 1
   1 4
   4 5
   5 1
   ```

3. **View Output**: After entering the data, the application will process the input and print the number of triangles found in the graph. For the example above, the output might look like:
   ```
   1
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to run the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the following when prompted:
   ```
   4 6
   1 2
   2 3
   3 1
   1 4
   4 2
   4 3
   ```

3. The output will display the number of triangles:
   ```
   1
   ```

## Conclusion

This application is a simple yet effective tool for counting triangles in an undirected graph. It can be extended or modified to include additional features or optimizations as needed. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
