Task:
Read integers H and W from standard input, representing the number of rows and columns of the grid. Initialize a 2D list 'grid' of size H x W to store the values of each square. Populate the 'grid' with values from standard input, where each value is either '+' (blue) or '-' (red). Initialize two variables 'takahashi_points' and 'aoki_points' to 0, representing the scores of both players. Implement a function 'play_game(x, y, turn)' to simulate the game:\n   - If the current player is Takahashi (turn = 0), increment 'takahashi_points' if the square is blue, decrement if red.\n   - If the current player is Aoki (turn = 1), increment 'aoki_points' if the square is blue, decrement if red. Check possible moves (right and down) from the current position (x, y):\n   - If moving right (to (x, y+1)) is within bounds, call 'play_game(x, y+1, 1 - turn)'.\n   - If moving down (to (x+1, y)) is within bounds, call 'play_game(x+1, y, 1 - turn)'. Start the game by calling 'play_game(0, 0, 0)' from the top-left corner of the grid. After the game ends, compare 'takahashi_points' and 'aoki_points' to determine the result:\n   - If 'takahashi_points > aoki_points', return Takahashi.\n   - If 'takahashi_points < aoki_points', return Aoki.\n   - If they are equal, return Draw. Print the result of the game based on the final scores of both players.
