# Takahashi vs Aoki Game

Welcome to the Takahashi vs Aoki game! This application allows two players to compete on a grid filled with blue ('+') and red ('-') squares, where each player scores points based on their moves.

## Main Functions

- **Grid Initialization**: The game starts by reading the dimensions of the grid (H x W) and populating it with values of either '+' or '-'.
- **Game Simulation**: The game is played by two players, Takahashi and Aoki, who take turns moving through the grid. Points are awarded or deducted based on the color of the square they land on.
- **Winner Determination**: After all possible moves are made, the game compares the scores of both players to declare a winner or a draw.
