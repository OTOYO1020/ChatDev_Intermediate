# ChatDev Integer Processing Application

This application is designed to read integers and perform calculations based on user-defined criteria. It processes input data and computes a result based on the relationships between the provided integers.

## Main Functions

- **Input Reading**: The application reads integers \(N\), \(M\), and \(X\), along with lists \(C\) and \(A\) from standard input.
- **Calculation Logic**: The core logic is implemented in the `calculate_result` function, which computes a result based on the weighted sums of the rows in list \(A\) against the threshold \(X\).
- **Output**: The application prints the final computed result to standard output.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - First line: Two integers \(N\) and \(M\) (1 ≤ \(N\), \(M\) ≤ 12).
   - Second line: An integer \(X\) (1 ≤ \(X\) ≤ 100000).
   - Third line: A list of \(M\) integers \(C_i\) (1 ≤ \(C_i\) ≤ 100000).
   - Next \(N\) lines: Each line contains \(M\) integers \(A_{i,j}\) (0 ≤ \(A_{i,j}\) ≤ 100000).

   Example input:
   ```
   3 2
   10
   1 2
   3 4
   5 6
   ```

3. **Output**: After providing the input, the application will process the data and print the result, which indicates how many rows in \(A\) have a weighted sum that meets or exceeds \(X\).

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
3 2
10
1 2
3 4
5 6
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

This output indicates that 2 rows in the list \(A\) have a weighted sum that meets or exceeds the threshold \(X\).

## Error Handling

The application includes validation checks for input values. If the input does not meet the specified criteria, a `ValueError` will be raised with a descriptive message. Ensure that the input adheres to the specified ranges to avoid errors.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to process integer data and perform calculations based on user-defined criteria. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily run the application and obtain results based on their input.
