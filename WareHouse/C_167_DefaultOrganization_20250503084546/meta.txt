Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input, where \(1 \leq N, M \leq 12\). Read integer X from standard input, where \(1 \leq X \leq 10^5\). Initialize a list 'C' of size M and read M integers \(C_i\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq C_i \leq 10^5\). Initialize a 2D list 'A' of size N x M and read N rows of M integers \(A_{i,j}\) from standard input, where \(0 \leq A_{i,j} \leq 10^5\). Implement a function 'calculate_result(N, M, X, C, A)' to process the input data. Inside 'calculate_result', iterate through each row of 'A' and apply the logic based on the values of 'C' and 'X'. Compute the desired result based on the processed data and store it in a variable 'result'. Return the computed 'result' from the 'calculate_result' function. Print the final value of 'result' to standard output.
