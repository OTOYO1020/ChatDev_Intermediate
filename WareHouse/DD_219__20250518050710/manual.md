# Lunchbox Command-Line Application

The Lunchbox application helps users determine if it's possible to buy lunchboxes that meet specific requirements for takoyaki and taiyaki. It calculates the minimum number of lunchboxes needed to satisfy these requirements.

## Main Functions

- **can_buy_lunchboxes(N: int, X: int, Y: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> Tuple[bool, int]**: 
  - Determines if it's possible to buy lunchboxes to meet the requirements for takoyaki (X) and taiyaki (Y).
  - Returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating the possibility and the minimum number of lunchboxes needed.

## Installation

To run the Lunchbox application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: You may need to install any additional libraries if required. For this application, the standard library is sufficient.

## How to Use the Application

### Running the Application

1. **Open your command line interface (CLI)**.
2. **Navigate to the directory** where the `main.py` file is located.
3. **Run the application** using the following command format:

   ```bash
   python main.py N X Y A B
   ```

   - **N**: The number of lunchboxes available.
   - **X**: The minimum number of takoyaki required.
   - **Y**: The minimum number of taiyaki required.
   - **A**: A comma-separated list of integers representing the number of takoyaki in each lunchbox.
   - **B**: A comma-separated list of integers representing the number of taiyaki in each lunchbox.

### Example Command

```bash
python main.py 3 5 3 2,3,4 1,2,3
```

This command checks if it's possible to buy lunchboxes from a selection of 3 lunchboxes, requiring at least 5 takoyaki and 3 taiyaki.

### Output

- If it is possible to buy the required lunchboxes, the output will be:
  ```
  Possible to buy lunchboxes. Minimum needed: X
  ```
  Where `X` is the minimum number of lunchboxes needed.

- If it is not possible, the output will be:
  ```
  Not possible to buy the required lunchboxes.
  ```

### Error Handling

- If the input format is incorrect or invalid, the application will provide an error message:
  ```
  Input Error: [Error Message]. Please provide valid inputs in the format: N X Y A B
  ```

## Conclusion

The Lunchbox command-line application is a straightforward tool for determining lunchbox purchasing possibilities based on specified requirements. With simple command-line usage, users can quickly assess their options for lunchbox selections.
