Task:
Define the function 'can_buy_lunchboxes(N: int, X: int, Y: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> Tuple[bool, int]' to determine if it's possible to buy lunchboxes to meet the requirements and to find the minimum number of lunchboxes needed. Parse the input to extract the values of N, X, Y, A, and B from the input format. Initialize a variable 'min_lunchboxes' to a large number to keep track of the minimum number of lunchboxes needed. Use a loop to iterate through all combinations of lunchboxes (using bit masking) to check every possible selection of lunchboxes. For each combination, calculate the total number of takoyaki and taiyaki obtained from the selected lunchboxes. Check if the total takoyaki is greater than or equal to X and total taiyaki is greater than or equal to Y. If the above condition is satisfied, update 'min_lunchboxes' with the number of lunchboxes used in the current combination if it's less than the current 'min_lunchboxes'. After checking all combinations, determine if 'min_lunchboxes' was updated; if not, set the result to indicate it's not possible. Return a tuple containing a boolean indicating the possibility and the minimum number of lunchboxes needed. Format the output based on the result from the function, indicating whether it's possible to buy the lunchboxes and the minimum number required.
