Task:
Input Handling: Read integers 'H' and 'W' from standard input, representing the number of rows and columns of the grid. / Read 'H' strings 'S_i' from standard input, each of length 'W', representing the grid layout where '#' indicates an obstacle and '.' indicates an empty square. / Store these strings in a list 'grid'. Initialize Data Structures: Create a 2D list 'light_count' of size 'H x W' initialized to zero, which will store the number of squares that can be lighted from each position. Calculate Horizontal Lighting: For each row 'i' in the grid: Initialize 'count' to zero. / {Traverse each column 'j' from left to right: If 'grid[i][j]' is '.', increment 'count' and set 'light_count[i][j]' to 'count'. / If 'grid[i][j]' is '#', reset 'count' to zero.} / Traverse each column 'j' from right to left to update 'light_count[i][j]' with the maximum of its current value and the count from the right. Calculate Vertical Lighting: For each column 'j' in the grid: Initialize 'count' to zero. / {Traverse each row 'i' from top to bottom: If 'grid[i][j]' is '.', increment 'count' and add it to 'light_count[i][j]'. / If 'grid[i][j]' is '#', reset 'count' to zero.} / Traverse each row 'i' from bottom to top to update 'light_count[i][j]' with the maximum of its current value and the count from below. Calculate Maximum Lighted Squares: Initialize 'max_lighted' to zero. / {For each square '(i, j)' in the grid: If 'grid[i][j]' is '.', update 'max_lighted' with the maximum of its current value and 'light_count[i][j] - 1' (subtract 1 to exclude the square itself from being counted twice).} Output the Result: Print the value of 'max_lighted', which represents the maximum number of squares that can be lighted by placing a lamp optimally on the grid.
