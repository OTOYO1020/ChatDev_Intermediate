# Subsequence Pair Counter

A Python application for counting valid pairs of subsequences from two integer sequences.

## Overview

This application provides a function to count the number of valid subsequence pairs from two given integer sequences. It reads input sequences, validates their lengths, and computes the total number of distinct non-empty subsequences formed by the integers in both sequences.

## Main Functions

- **count_subsequence_pairs(S: List[int], T: List[int]) -> int**: 
  - This function takes two lists of integers, `S` and `T`, and returns the total count of valid subsequence pairs. 
  - It utilizes a helper function to count occurrences of each integer in the sequences and calculates the number of valid pairs based on these counts.

- **subsequence_count(sequence: List[int]) -> Dict[int, int]**: 
  - This helper function counts the occurrences of each integer in a given sequence and returns a dictionary with integers as keys and their counts as values.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install collections
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input Format**: The application expects two lines of input, where each line contains space-separated integers representing the sequences `S` and `T`.

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Save the provided code into two files: `main.py` and `subsequence.py`.
   - Run the application using the command line. You can provide input directly or through a file.

   Example command to run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Example Input**:
   ```
   1 2 2 3
   2 3 3 4
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will print the total valid subsequence pairs based on the input sequences.

   Example output:
   ```
   Total valid subsequence pairs: 6
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the input does not contain two sequences, the application will print an error message:
  ```
  Error: Please provide two sequences.
  ```

- If the lengths of the sequences are not within the specified constraints (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2000), the application will print:
  ```
  Error: Sequences must have lengths between 1 and 2000.
  ```

- If the input contains invalid integers, the application will print:
  ```
  Error: Please enter valid integer sequences.
  ```

## Conclusion

This application is designed to efficiently count valid subsequence pairs from two integer sequences. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily run the application and obtain results based on their input sequences.
