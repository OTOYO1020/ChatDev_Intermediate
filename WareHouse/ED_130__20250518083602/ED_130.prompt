Define a function 'count_subsequence_pairs(S: List[int], T: List[int]) -> int' to handle the main logic of counting pairs of subsequences. Implement input handling to read two integer sequences 'S' and 'T' from standard input, ensuring they are of lengths 'N' and 'M' respectively. Validate that the lengths of 'S' and 'T' are within the specified constraints (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2000). Create a helper function 'subsequence_count(sequence: List[int]) -> Dict[int, int]' to count occurrences of each integer in the subsequence. Utilize the helper function to compute the frequency of each integer in both sequences 'S' and 'T'. Calculate the number of valid subsequence pairs by iterating through the unique integers in both sequences and using their frequencies. Implement logic to account for the distinct subsequences by considering the combinations of indices for each integer. Ensure that the final count of pairs is computed modulo (10^9 + 7) to handle large numbers. Return the result from the 'count_subsequence_pairs' function. Print the output in the required format after invoking the function.
