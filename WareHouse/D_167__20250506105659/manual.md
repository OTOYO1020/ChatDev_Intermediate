# Teleportation Simulation

A Python application to simulate teleportation between towns based on user-defined destinations.

## Main Functions

The teleportation simulation software allows users to:
- Input the number of towns and teleportation destinations.
- Simulate teleportation for a specified number of iterations.
- Detect cycles in the teleportation process to optimize performance, especially for large values of teleportations (up to 10^18).
- Output the final town after the teleportation process.

## Quick Install

To run the teleportation simulation, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/teleportation-simulation.git
cd teleportation-simulation
```

### Install Dependencies

No external dependencies are required for this application, as it uses built-in Python functionalities. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the application is located, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - You will be prompted to enter the number of towns (N).
   - Next, enter the number of teleportations (K).
   - Finally, input the teleportation destinations as a comma-separated list (e.g., `2,3,1`).

3. **Output**: After entering the required inputs, the application will process the teleportation simulation and output the final town number after K teleportations.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter number of towns (N): 3
Enter number of teleportations (K): 10
Enter teleportation destinations (comma-separated, e.g., 2,3,1): 2,3,1
The final town after 10 teleportations is: 2
```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for user inputs:
- If the number of destinations does not match the number of towns (N), an error message will be displayed.
- If any destination is out of the valid range (1 to N), an error message will be shown.
- Any unexpected errors will also be caught and displayed.

## Additional Information

For more details on the teleportation logic, you can refer to the `teleportation.py` module, which contains the core functionality of the simulation.
