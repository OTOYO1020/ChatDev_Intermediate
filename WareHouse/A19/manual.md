# Hit and Blow Game User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Hit and Blow Game! This game is a fun and challenging number guessing game where you have to predict a three-digit number with different digits. You will be given feedback on your guesses in the form of hits and blows. A hit means that both the number and the digit position are correct, while a blow means that only the number is correct but the digit position is wrong. The objective is to guess the number within seven tries.

## Installation

To play the Hit and Blow Game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can follow these steps to install the game:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the game files.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

To start the game, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the game files. Run the following command to start the game:

```
python main.py
```

A window will appear with the game interface. The interface will display a welcome message, the number of remaining lives, and an input field for you to enter your guess.

To make a guess, enter a three-digit number in the input field and press the "Submit" button. The game will provide feedback on your guess in the form of hits and blows. The number of remaining lives will also be updated.

If you enter an invalid input, such as a number with duplicate digits or a number that is not three digits long, the game will display an error message and ask you to enter a valid input.

The game will continue until you guess the number correctly, run out of lives, or choose to exit the game.

## Tips

Here are some tips to help you improve your chances of guessing the number correctly:

1. Pay attention to the feedback provided by the game. Hits indicate that you have guessed a correct digit in the correct position, while blows indicate that you have guessed a correct digit in the wrong position. Use this information to narrow down your guesses.

2. Keep track of your previous guesses and their corresponding hits and blows. This will help you eliminate possibilities and make more informed guesses.

3. Use a systematic approach to guess the number. Start with a random three-digit number and adjust it based on the feedback from the game. Repeat this process until you guess the number correctly.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You are now ready to play the Hit and Blow Game. Have fun and enjoy the challenge of guessing the three-digit number. Good luck!
