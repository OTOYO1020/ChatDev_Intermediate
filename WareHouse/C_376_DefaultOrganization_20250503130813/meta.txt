Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of toys and boxes. Read the array A of size N, which contains the sizes of the toys (A[i] for i from 1 to N). Read the array B of size N-1, which contains the sizes of the existing boxes (B[i] for i from 1 to N-1). Determine the maximum size of the toys, 'maxToySize = max(A)'. Sort the array B in ascending order to facilitate the placement of toys into boxes. Initialize a variable 'requiredBoxes' to 0 to count how many boxes are needed. Iterate through the sorted array B and check how many toys can be placed in the existing boxes:\n   - For each box size B[j], check if it can accommodate the next toy in the sorted toy sizes.\n   - Increment 'requiredBoxes' for each toy that can be placed. If 'requiredBoxes' is less than N, calculate the minimum size of the new box 'x' needed to accommodate the remaining toys:\n   - Set 'x = maxToySize' if 'requiredBoxes' is less than N. Print the minimum size of the box 'x' that allows all toys to be stored, or indicate that it is not possible if no such box exists. Ensure the output format is correct, displaying the result as a single integer.
