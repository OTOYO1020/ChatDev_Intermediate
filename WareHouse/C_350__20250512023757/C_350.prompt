Define the function 'transform_permutation(N: int, A: List[int]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters, where 'N' is the size of the permutation and 'A' is the list representing the permutation. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the list 'A' from standard input. Verify that the input list 'A' is a valid permutation of integers from '1' to 'N'. Create a loop to perform the swap operations between '0' and 'N-1' times to sort the list 'A' into the ordered sequence '(1, 2, ..., N)'. Within the loop, implement a mechanism to select pairs '(i, j)' such that '1 <= i < j <= N' for swapping elements in 'A'. Perform the swap operation on the elements at indices 'i' and 'j' in the list 'A'. Check if the list 'A' is sorted after each swap operation to potentially break out of the loop early if sorted. Return the sorted list 'A' as the output of the function. Implement error handling to ensure that the input values are within the specified constraints. Format the output of the function to match the required output format, which is a list of integers representing the sorted permutation.
