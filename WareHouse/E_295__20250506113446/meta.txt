Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input, followed by the sequence A of length N. Initialize a variable 'expected_value' to 0 to accumulate the expected values of the elements in A. For each index 'i' in A:\n   - If 'A[i]' is 0, compute the expected value of replacing 'A[i]' with a uniform random integer between 1 and M.\n   - Update 'expected_value' by adding the contribution of this expected value. Sort the modified sequence A in ascending order. Identify the K-th element in the sorted sequence A, denoted as 'A[K-1]'. Represent the expected value as a fraction 'P/Q', where P is the numerator and Q is the denominator. Compute the modular inverse of Q modulo 998244353. Calculate the result R using the formula 'R = (P * Q_inverse) % 998244353'. Print the result R. Ensure all calculations handle large integers and modular arithmetic correctly.
