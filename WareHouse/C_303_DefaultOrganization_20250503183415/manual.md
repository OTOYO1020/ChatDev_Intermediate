# Takahashi Game

A fun and engaging game where you control Takahashi's movements and manage his health as he navigates through a grid.

## Main Functions

- **Movement Control**: Move Takahashi in four directions: Right (R), Left (L), Up (U), and Down (D).
- **Health Management**: Takahashi starts with a specified health value and can recover health by collecting health items located at specific coordinates.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends if Takahashi's health drops below zero or if he attempts to move out of bounds.

## Quick Install

To run the Takahashi Game, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: If there are specific dependencies, please create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary packages.)

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Takahashi Game is a simple simulation where players control a character's movements on a grid while managing health points. The game challenges players to navigate effectively while collecting health items to sustain their character.

   - `N`: Length of the movement string.
   - `M`: Number of health recovery items.
   - `H`: Initial health of Takahashi.
   - `K`: Health threshold for recovery.

2. **Health Item Coordinates**: Enter `M` pairs of integers representing the coordinates of health recovery items in the format `(x_i, y_i)`.

3. **Movement String**: Enter a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'L', 'U', and 'D' to dictate Takahashi's movements.

4. **Game Execution**: The game will process the moves and output either "YES" if Takahashi survives or "NO" if he runs out of health or moves out of bounds.
