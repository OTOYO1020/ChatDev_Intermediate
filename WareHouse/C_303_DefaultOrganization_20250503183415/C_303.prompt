Read integers N, M, H, K from standard input. Read the string S of length N from standard input. Read M pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of health recovery items and store them in a set for quick access. Initialize Takahashi's current position at (0, 0) and set his current health to H. Iterate through each character S_i in the string S:\n   - Decrease Takahashi's health by 1 for each move.\n   - Update Takahashi's position based on the direction indicated by S_i:\n     - If S_i is 'R', move to (x+1, y).\n     - If S_i is 'L', move to (x-1, y).\n     - If S_i is 'U', move to (x, y+1).\n     - If S_i is 'D', move to (x, y-1). After each move, check if Takahashi's health is negative:\n   - If yes, print NO and terminate. If Takahashi's health is non-negative and he moves to a position with a health item (x_i, y_i), check if his health is strictly less than K:\n   - If yes, set his health to K. After completing all moves, if Takahashi's health is non-negative, print YES. Ensure to handle edge cases such as moving out of bounds or encountering health items at the starting position.\n\nThis breakdown provides a clear sequence of tasks to implement the solution based on the problem statement.
