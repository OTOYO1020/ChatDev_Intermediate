Read integers N and K from standard input. Validate that K is an odd number and that 1 â‰¤ K < N â‰¤ 1000. Initialize an empty list 'A' of length N to store the determined values of the sequence. Initialize a counter 'query_count' to track the number of queries made. While 'query_count' is less than N:\n   - Select K distinct integers 'x_1, x_2, ..., x_K' from the range [1, N].\n   - Print the query in the format '? x_1 x_2 ... x_K' to standard output.\n   - Flush the output to ensure the judge receives the query. Read the response 'T' from standard input:\n   - If T is -1, terminate the program immediately as it indicates an invalid query.\n   - If T is 0 or 1, update the parity information based on the response. Use the responses to deduce the values of the sequence A:\n   - Implement logic to determine the values of A based on the parity responses received. Once all elements of A are determined, print the result in the format '! A_1 A_2 ... A_N' to standard output. Ensure to flush the output after printing the final result to avoid any potential TLE. Terminate the program immediately after printing the answer to ensure correct verdict.
