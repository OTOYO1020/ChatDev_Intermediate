Task:
Define the function 'def block_exists(N: int, W: int, blocks: List[Tuple[int, int]], Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[str]:' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the number of blocks, 'W' is the number of columns, 'blocks' is a list of tuples representing the positions of the blocks, 'Q' is the number of queries, and 'queries' is a list of tuples containing the block index and time. Parse the input values to extract 'N', 'W', 'blocks', 'Q', and 'queries' from the input format. Initialize a grid representation to track the positions of the blocks, considering the rules for movement and removal of blocks in the bottom row. Implement the logic to simulate the movement of blocks over time, specifically checking the conditions for removing blocks from the bottom row and moving blocks downward. For each query in 'queries', determine if the specified block 'A_j' exists at time 'T_j + 0.5' by checking its position after the simulation of movements. Store the results of each query in a list to be returned at the end of the function. Ensure that the simulation handles the maximum constraints efficiently, particularly for large values of 'T_j' and 'Y_i'. Return the results list as output from the function in the required format. Implement error handling for invalid input cases, ensuring that all constraints are respected. Test the function with various test cases to validate correctness and performance.
