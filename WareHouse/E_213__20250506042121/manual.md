# Takahashi Punches Calculator

A tool to determine the minimum number of punches needed for Takahashi to reach the fish market in a grid representation.

## Overview

The Takahashi Punches Calculator allows users to input a grid of passable and blocked cells, and calculates the minimum number of punches required to clear a path from the starting position (top-left corner) to the target position (bottom-right corner). The grid consists of characters representing passable cells ('.') and blocked cells ('#').

## Main Functions

1. **can_reach_market(S, H, W)**: 
   - Checks if Takahashi can reach the fish market without any punches.
   - Utilizes a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid.

2. **min_punches_needed(S, H, W)**: 
   - Calculates the minimum number of punches needed for Takahashi to reach the market.
   - Simulates punching 2x2 blocks of cells and checks if the market becomes reachable.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Punches Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install collections
   ```

## Usage

To use the Takahashi Punches Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Input**: The program expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain two integers, H and W, representing the dimensions of the grid.
   - The next H lines should contain strings of length W, where each character is either '.' (passable) or '#' (block).

   Example input:
   ```
   4 4
   .##.
   .##.
   .... 
   .##.
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: After running the command, input the grid dimensions and the grid representation as described above.

4. **View Output**: The program will output the minimum number of punches needed for Takahashi to reach the fish market. If the market is unreachable, it will return -1.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to run the program:

1. Save the following input in a text file (e.g., `input.txt`):
   ```
   4 4
   .##.
   .##.
   ....
   .##.
   ```

2. Run the program and redirect the input from the file:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

3. The output will display the minimum number of punches needed.

## Conclusion

The Takahashi Punches Calculator is a straightforward tool for navigating grid-based challenges. By following the instructions above, users can easily determine the necessary actions to reach their goals in a blocked environment.
