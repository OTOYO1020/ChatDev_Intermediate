Task:
Read integers H and W from standard input, representing the dimensions of the grid. Read the grid representation S, which consists of H strings of length W, where each character is either '.' (passable) or '#' (block). Initialize a variable 'min_punches' to store the minimum number of punches needed, starting at 0. Create a function 'can_reach_market(S, H, W)' that checks if Takahashi can reach the fish market without any punches. In 'can_reach_market', implement a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all passable cells from the starting position (0, 0) to the target position (H-1, W-1). If the market is reachable without punches, return 0 as the result. If not reachable, implement a loop to simulate the punching of 2x2 blocks:\n   - For each possible 2x2 block position in the grid, temporarily convert the blocks to passable cells and check if the market is reachable using 'can_reach_market'.\n   - Count the number of punches used and update 'min_punches' if a smaller number is found. Repeat the punching simulation until all possible 2x2 blocks have been considered. Print the value of 'min_punches' as the final output, which represents the minimum number of punches needed for Takahashi to reach the fish market.
