Task:
Read the integer K from standard input. Initialize a list '321_like_numbers' to store valid 321-like Numbers. Create a function 'is_321_like_number(x)' that checks if a given positive integer x is a 321-like Number:\n   - Convert x to a string to access its digits.\n   - Iterate through the digits and check if they are strictly decreasing. Initialize a variable 'current_number' starting from 1 to find 321-like Numbers. Use a loop to increment 'current_number':\n   - Call 'is_321_like_number(current_number)' to check if it is a 321-like Number.\n   - If true, append 'current_number' to '321_like_numbers'. Continue until the length of '321_like_numbers' is at least K. Retrieve the K-th smallest 321-like Number from '321_like_numbers'. Print the K-th smallest 321-like Number as the output.
