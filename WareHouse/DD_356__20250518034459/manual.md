# Popcount Sum Calculator

A simple application to compute the sum of popcounts for bitwise AND operations.

## Overview

The Popcount Sum Calculator allows users to calculate the sum of the number of 1s in the binary representation of the result of the bitwise AND operation between integers in a specified range and a given integer. This is useful in various applications involving binary operations and bit manipulation.

## Main Functions

- **compute_popcount_sum(N: int, M: int) -> int**: This function computes the sum of popcounts for `k & M` for all integers `k` in the range from `0` to `N`, inclusive.
  
- **popcount(x: int) -> int**: A helper function that calculates the number of 1s in the binary representation of the integer `x`.

## Installation

To run the Popcount Sum Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The application does not require any external dependencies beyond the standard library.

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   Simply execute the `main.py` file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input**: When prompted, enter two non-negative integers `N` and `M`. Ensure that both integers do not exceed `10^6`.

2. **Output**: The application will compute and display the Popcount Sum based on the provided inputs.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter N: 5
Enter M: 3
Popcount Sum: 8
```

In this example, the program calculates the sum of the number of 1s in the binary representation of the results of `k & M` for `k` ranging from `0` to `5`.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for input validation:
- If either `N` or `M` is negative, a message will indicate that both must be non-negative integers.
- If either `N` or `M` exceeds `10^6`, an error message will inform the user of the constraint.

## Conclusion

The Popcount Sum Calculator is a straightforward tool for performing bitwise operations and counting binary digits. It is designed for ease of use and efficiency, making it suitable for educational purposes and practical applications in programming involving binary data.
