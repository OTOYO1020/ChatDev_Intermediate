Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of users. Initialize two lists: 'current_handles' and 'desired_handles' to store the current handles \( S_i \) and the desired handles \( T_i \) respectively. For each user from 1 to N, read the current handle \( S_i \) and the desired handle \( T_i \) and populate the 'current_handles' and 'desired_handles' lists. Create a set 'used_handles' to keep track of handles that are currently in use during the handle change process. Initialize an empty list 'change_order' to store the order of handle changes. For each user, check if the desired handle \( T_i \) is already in the 'used_handles' set:\n   - If not, add \( S_i \) to 'used_handles', change \( S_i \) to \( T_i \), and add \( T_i \) to 'used_handles' and 'change_order'.\n   - If it is, find a user whose current handle can be temporarily changed to a handle not in 'used_handles' to free up \( T_i \). Implement a mechanism to ensure that each handle change is valid and does not violate the constraints of simultaneous handle usage. If all handle changes can be performed successfully, return the 'change_order' list. If any handle change cannot be performed due to constraints, output an error message indicating that the requests cannot be fulfilled. Print the final order of handle changes or the error message based on the success of the operations.
