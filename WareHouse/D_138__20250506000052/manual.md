# Tree Counter Application

A Python application for efficiently managing and updating counters in a tree structure based on user-defined operations.

## Overview

The Tree Counter Application allows users to create a tree structure using vertices and edges, and perform operations to increment counters for subtrees rooted at specific vertices. This is particularly useful in scenarios where hierarchical data needs to be manipulated efficiently.

## Main Functions

- **Tree Structure Creation**: Initialize a tree with N vertices and N-1 edges.
- **Counter Management**: Maintain a counter for each vertex and update these counters based on subtree operations.
- **Efficient Traversal**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and apply updates to the counters.

## Installation

To run the Tree Counter Application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have any external dependencies beyond the standard library. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run Python scripts.

## Usage

To use the Tree Counter Application, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in a specific format. You can provide input through standard input or by redirecting from a file. The input format is as follows:
   ```
   N Q
   a1 b1
   a2 b2
   ...
   a(N-1) b(N-1)
   p1 x1
   p2 x2
   ...
   pQ xQ
   ```
   - `N`: Number of vertices in the tree.
   - `Q`: Number of operations to perform.
   - Each subsequent line contains an edge connecting two vertices.
   - The last Q lines contain the operations specifying the vertex and the increment value.

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the application using Python.
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```
   Replace `input.txt` with your input file or provide input directly in the terminal.

3. **Output**: The application will print the final counter values for each vertex from 1 to N, each on a new line.

## Example

### Input
```
5 3
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
1 10
2 5
3 7
```

### Output
```
22
15
7
0
0
```
