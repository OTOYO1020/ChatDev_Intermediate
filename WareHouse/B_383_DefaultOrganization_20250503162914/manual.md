# Humidification Calculator

A tool for calculating the maximum number of humidified cells in a grid representation of an office space.

## Overview

The Humidification Calculator allows users to input a grid that represents an office layout, where floor cells are marked with `.` and walls are marked with `#`. The software calculates the maximum number of floor cells that can be humidified by placing two humidifiers within a specified Manhattan distance.

## Main Functions

- **Input Grid**: Users can input the dimensions of the grid (Height and Width) and the distance (D) for humidification.
- **Grid Validation**: The software ensures that the grid input meets the specified requirements (only `.` and `#` characters).
- **Humidification Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of humidified cells based on the positions of two distinct humidifiers.

## Installation

To run the Humidification Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the code files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies, install them using pip. For this project, no external libraries are required, but ensure you have Python's standard library.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements file is provided
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the program.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**: The program will prompt you to enter the following:
   - Height (H): The number of rows in the grid.
   - Width (W): The number of columns in the grid.
   - Distance (D): The maximum Manhattan distance for humidification.

3. **Enter the Grid**: After entering the parameters, you will be prompted to input the grid row by row. Use `.` for floor cells and `#` for wall cells. Ensure each row is exactly W characters long.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter Height (H): 4
   Enter Width (W): 5
   Enter Distance (D): 2
   Enter Grid (row by row, use '.' for floor and '#' for wall):
   ..#..
   .#...
   ..#..
   .....
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the grid, the program will calculate and display the maximum number of humidified cells.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Maximum Humidified Cells: 8
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the input grid does not meet the specified requirements (e.g., incorrect characters or row lengths), the program will prompt you to re-enter the grid.
- If there are not enough floor cells to place two humidifiers, an error message will be displayed.
