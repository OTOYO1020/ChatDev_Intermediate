Task:
Read integers H, W, and D from standard input. Read the grid representation of the office, storing it in a 2D list 'grid' of size H x W. Identify and store the coordinates of all floor cells (cells with '.') in a list 'floor_cells'. Initialize a variable 'max_humidified' to keep track of the maximum number of humidified cells. Iterate over all pairs of distinct floor cells (i, j) from 'floor_cells':\n   - For each pair, create a set 'humidified_cells' to store the humidified cell coordinates.\n   - For each floor cell (x, y) in 'floor_cells', check if it is within the Manhattan distance D from either of the two selected humidifier cells:\n     - If '|x - i| + |y - j| <= D', add (x, y) to 'humidified_cells'. Update 'max_humidified' with the size of 'humidified_cells' if it is greater than the current 'max_humidified'. After checking all pairs, print the value of 'max_humidified' as the result.
