# Smallest Integer Finder

A Python application to find the smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the equation \( X = a^3 + a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \).

## Main Functions

The application consists of two main components:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads an integer \( N \) from the user.
2. **Computation Logic**: Implements the algorithm to find the smallest integer \( X \) that meets the specified conditions.

## How to Install Environment Dependencies

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can set up the environment by following these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   You may need to install any additional dependencies. For this application, you can simply run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If there are no specific dependencies listed, you can directly run the application without additional installations.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located, and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input an Integer**:
   When prompted, enter a non-negative integer \( N \). The application will initialize \( X \) to \( N \) and begin searching for the smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the equation.

3. **Output**:
   After the computation, the application will print the smallest integer \( X \) that meets the conditions.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter an integer N: 10
The smallest X is: 10
```

## Additional Information

- **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling to ensure that the input is a valid integer. If an invalid input is provided, the user will be prompted to enter a valid integer.

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: The computation logic is optimized to reduce unnecessary iterations, making it efficient for larger values of \( N \).
