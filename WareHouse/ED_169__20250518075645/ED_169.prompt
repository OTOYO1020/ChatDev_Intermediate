Define the function 'count_median_values(N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of integers, A is the list of lower bounds, and B is the list of upper bounds. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the lists A and B from standard input. Ensure that the constraints for N (2 ≤ N ≤ 200000) and the values in A and B (1 ≤ A_i ≤ B_i ≤ 10^9) are checked and validated. Sort the values of A and B to prepare for median calculation. Determine the possible values for the median based on the sorted lists A and B. If N is odd, calculate the median using the formula 'x_{(N+1)/2}'; if N is even, calculate it using '(x_{N/2} + x_{N/2+1}) / 2'. Count the number of distinct median values that can be formed from the ranges defined by A and B. Store the distinct median values in a set to ensure uniqueness. Return the size of the set as the final count of different median values. Implement output handling to print the result of the function.
