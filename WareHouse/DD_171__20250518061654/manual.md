# Integer Operations Dashboard

A user-friendly application for performing operations on a list of integers through a graphical interface.

## Overview

The Integer Operations Dashboard allows users to input a list of integers and a series of operations to perform on that list. Each operation consists of replacing occurrences of a specified integer with another integer and calculating the sum of the modified list after each operation. This application is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Main Functions

- **Input List of Integers**: Users can enter a list of integers separated by commas.
- **Define Operations**: Users can specify operations in the format `(B,C)` where `B` is the integer to be replaced and `C` is the integer to replace it with. Multiple operations can be entered, separated by semicolons.
- **Display Results**: After performing the operations, the application displays the sum of the modified list after each operation.

## Installation

To run the Integer Operations Dashboard, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Install Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with most Python installations. If you encounter issues, you can install it using:
   - For Windows: Tkinter is included with the standard Python installation.
   - For macOS: Install via Homebrew with `brew install python-tk`.
   - For Linux: Install using your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `main.py` file to start the application. You can do this by navigating to the directory containing the file in your terminal and executing:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the List of Integers**:
   - In the input field labeled "Enter List of Integers (comma-separated):", enter your list of integers. For example: `1,2,3,4,5`.

3. **Define Operations**:
   - In the input field labeled "Enter Operations (B_i, C_i) as (B,C):", enter your operations in the format `(B,C)`. For example: `(2,3);(4,5)` to replace `2` with `3` and `4` with `5`.

4. **Run Operations**:
   - Click the "Run Operations" button to execute the defined operations on the list of integers.

5. **View Results**:
   - The results will be displayed in the output area, showing the sum of the modified list after each operation.

## Example Usage

1. **Input**:
   - List of Integers: `1,2,3,4,5`
   - Operations: `(2,3);(4,5)`

2. **Output**:
   - After the first operation, the sum will be `1 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 16`.
   - After the second operation, the sum will be `1 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 17`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you receive an error regarding invalid input, ensure that your list of integers and operations are formatted correctly.
- **No Output**: If no results are displayed, check that you have entered valid operations and that the integers to be replaced exist in the list.
