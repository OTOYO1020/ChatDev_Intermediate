Task:
Define a function 'perform_operations(N: int, Q: int, A: List[int], operations: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the values of N, Q, the list A of integers, and the list of operations (B_i, C_i) for each i. Initialize a variable 'results' as an empty list to store the sum of elements after each operation. Iterate over each operation from 1 to Q, and for each operation, replace all occurrences of B_i in A with C_i. After performing the replacement for operation i, calculate the sum of the modified list A and append it to 'results'. Ensure that the replacement only occurs if B_i exists in A, as per the problem constraints. Return the 'results' list containing the sums after each operation as the output of the function. Handle edge cases where no replacements occur by ensuring the sum is calculated correctly regardless. Make sure to validate that B_i is not equal to C_i before performing the replacement, as specified in the constraints. Output the results in the format of a list of integers, each representing the sum after the corresponding operation.
