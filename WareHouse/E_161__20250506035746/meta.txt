Task:
Read integers N, K, and C from standard input. Read the string S of length N from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'workdays' to store the days Takahashi will work. Initialize a variable 'current_day' to 0 to track the current day index. Loop until the length of 'workdays' is less than K:\n   - Check if the character at index 'current_day' in S is 'o':\n     - If true, append 'current_day + 1' to 'workdays' (since days are 1-indexed).\n     - Increment 'current_day' by 'C + 1' to account for the days off after working.\n   - If false, simply increment 'current_day' by 1 to check the next day. Ensure that 'current_day' does not exceed N during the loop. Print the contents of 'workdays' as the final output.
