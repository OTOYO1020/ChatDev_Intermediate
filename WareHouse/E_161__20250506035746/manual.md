# Workdays Calculator

A simple application to calculate the workdays based on a given schedule.

## Overview

The Workdays Calculator allows users to determine which days Takahashi will work based on a string representation of work ('o') and off ('x') days. The application reads the total number of days, the number of workdays to find, and the number of days off after working.

## Main Functions

- **calculate_workdays(N, K, C, S)**: This function calculates the workdays based on the input parameters.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `N` (int): Total number of days.
    - `K` (int): Number of workdays to find.
    - `C` (int): Number of days off after working.
    - `S` (str): String representing work ('o') and off ('x') days.
  - **Returns**: A list of workdays (1-indexed).

## Installation

To run the Workdays Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

There are no additional dependencies required for this application. The code is written in pure Python and should work with any standard Python installation.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application directly from the command line.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - First line: Three integers `N`, `K`, and `C` separated by spaces.
   - Second line: A string `S` of length `N` consisting of characters 'o' and 'x'.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   10 3 2
   ooxoooxxoo
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will print a list of workdays (1-indexed) based on the input provided.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   [1, 4, 8]
   ```

## Conclusion

The Workdays Calculator is a straightforward tool for determining workdays based on a specified schedule. By following the steps outlined above, users can easily install and run the application to get their desired results.
