Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the size of the grid. Read the integer M from standard input, which represents the number of black pawns. Initialize a list 'black_pawns' to store the positions of the black pawns. For each black pawn (from 1 to M), read its position '(X_i, Y_i)' and append it to 'black_pawns'. Create a grid representation or a set to track the positions of the black pawns for efficient lookup. Initialize a variable 'reachable_Y_count' to count the number of valid Y positions for the white pawn at '(2N, Y)'. Iterate over all possible Y values from 0 to 2N:\n   - Check if the white pawn can reach '(2N, Y)' based on the movement rules and the positions of the black pawns.\n   - If reachable, increment 'reachable_Y_count'. Print the final value of 'reachable_Y_count' as the result.\n\nThis breakdown captures the necessary steps to implement the solution for the problem statement, including handling input and output formats.
