Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers in the sequence. Read the sequence of N integers A from standard input. Initialize a variable 'sum_of_inverses' to 0 to hold the sum of the inverses of the integers. Loop through each integer A[i] in the sequence:\n   - Compute the inverse of A[i] as 'inverse = 1 / A[i]'.\n   - Add 'inverse' to 'sum_of_inverses'. Calculate the multiplicative inverse of 'sum_of_inverses' as 'result = 1 / sum_of_inverses'. Print the result.
