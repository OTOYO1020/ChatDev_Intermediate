# Inverse Calculator

A simple application to calculate the multiplicative inverse of the sum of inverses of a sequence of positive integers.

## Main Functions

The Inverse Calculator performs the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads an integer N that represents the number of integers in the sequence and the sequence of N positive integers.
2. **Calculation**: Computes the sum of the inverses of the integers in the sequence.
3. **Output**: Calculates and prints the multiplicative inverse of the sum of inverses.

## Installation

To run the Inverse Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

## How to Use the Inverse Calculator

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: 
   - When prompted, enter the number of positive integers (N).
   - Next, enter the sequence of N positive integers separated by spaces.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of positive integers (N): 3
   Enter the sequence of positive integers (space-separated): 2 4 8
   ```

4. **View Result**: The application will compute and display the result.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Result: 0.2857142857142857
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the number of integers entered does not match N, an error message will be displayed.
- If any of the integers entered are not positive, an error message will be displayed.
- If the sum of inverses is zero (which should not occur with valid input), an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Inverse Calculator is a straightforward tool for performing mathematical operations on a sequence of positive integers. For any issues or questions, please refer to the code comments or reach out for support.
