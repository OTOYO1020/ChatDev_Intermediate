# Majority Value Calculator

A utility for calculating the majority value from binary strings using a recursive reduction approach.

## Quick Install

To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ü§î What is this?

The Majority Value Calculator is designed to process binary strings of length \(3^N\) and apply majority operations to reduce them to a single binary digit. The main functionalities include:

- **Majority Value Calculation**: Determine the majority value from a group of three binary digits.
- **Binary String Reduction**: Recursively apply majority operations to reduce a binary string to a single character.
- **Change Counting**: Calculate the minimum number of changes needed to convert the reduced binary string to a specified target value.

## üìñ Main Functions

### 1. `majority_value(group)`

- **Input**: A group of three binary digits (e.g., '010').
- **Output**: Returns the majority value (0 or 1).

### 2. `apply_operation(B)`

- **Input**: A binary string \(B\) of length \(3^n\).
- **Output**: Produces a new binary string \(C\) of length \(3^{(n-1)}\) by applying the majority operation.

### 3. `reduce_string(A, N)`

- **Input**: A binary string \(A\) and an integer \(N\).
- **Output**: Applies the `apply_operation` function \(N\) times to \(A\), returning the final single character.

### 4. `count_changes(A, target)`

- **Input**: A binary string \(A\) and a target value (0 or 1).
- **Output**: Counts the minimum number of changes required to convert \(A\) to the specified target value.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` script in your terminal.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Handling**:
   - Enter a binary string \(A\) of length \(3^N\) when prompted.
   - Enter the integer \(N\) which determines the length of the binary string.

3. **Validation**: The application will validate the input to ensure:
   - The binary string is of length \(3^N\).
   - The string consists only of binary digits (0 and 1).

4. **Output**: After processing, the application will output the minimum number of changes required to convert the reduced binary string to the target value.

## üìú Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter binary string (length 3^N): 110001
Enter integer N: 2
Changes needed: 1
```

In this example, the binary string `110001` is processed, and the application determines that 1 change is needed to reach the target value.

## üìù Notes

- Ensure that your input string is correctly formatted to avoid validation errors.
- The application is designed to handle binary strings of specific lengths, so be mindful of the \(N\) value you provide.
