Define a function 'count_happy_sets(A: int, B: int) -> int' that takes two integers A and B as input. Generate a list of integers 'cards' containing all integers from A to B inclusive. Implement a helper function 'is_coprime(x: int, y: int) -> bool' that checks if two integers x and y are coprime. Create a function 'generate_subsets(cards: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]' that generates all possible subsets of the 'cards' list. Iterate through each subset of cards and check if all pairs of numbers in the subset are pairwise coprime using the 'is_coprime' function. Count the number of subsets that satisfy the pairwise coprime condition and store this count in a variable 'happy_count'. Return the value of 'happy_count' from the 'count_happy_sets' function. Handle input reading and parsing to extract integers A and B from the input format. Call the 'count_happy_sets' function with the parsed A and B values. Output the result as an integer representing the number of happy sets.
