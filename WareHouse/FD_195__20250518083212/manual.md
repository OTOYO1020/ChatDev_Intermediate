# Happy Sets

Counting the number of happy sets between two integers.

## Quick Install

To run the Happy Sets application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🤔 What is this?

The Happy Sets application allows users to count the number of subsets of integers between two given numbers (inclusive) that are pairwise coprime. A set of integers is considered "happy" if every pair of integers in the set is coprime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1.

## 📦 Main Functions

### 1. `count_happy_sets(A: int, B: int) -> int`

This function takes two integers, A and B, and counts the number of happy sets formed by the integers from A to B inclusive.

- **Parameters**:
  - `A`: The starting integer.
  - `B`: The ending integer.
  
- **Returns**: 
  - An integer representing the number of happy sets.

### 2. `is_coprime(x: int, y: int) -> bool`

This helper function checks if two integers are coprime.

- **Parameters**:
  - `x`: The first integer.
  - `y`: The second integer.
  
- **Returns**: 
  - `True` if x and y are coprime, otherwise `False`.

### 3. `generate_subsets(cards: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]`

This function generates all possible subsets of a given list of integers.

- **Parameters**:
  - `cards`: A list of integers.
  
- **Returns**: 
  - A list of all subsets of the input list.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
   - Run the application using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input**:
   - When prompted, enter two integers A and B separated by a space (e.g., `3 7`).

3. **Output**:
   - The application will output the number of happy sets between the integers A and B.

## Example

```bash
Enter two integers A and B (space-separated): 3 7
Number of Happy Sets: 8
```
