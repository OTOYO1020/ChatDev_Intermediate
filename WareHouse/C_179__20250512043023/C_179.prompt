Define a function 'count_tuples(N: int) -> int' that takes a positive integer N as input. Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to keep track of the number of valid tuples (A, B, C). Use a loop to iterate over possible values of A from 1 to N (inclusive). For each value of A, use another loop to iterate over possible values of B from 1 to (N // A) (inclusive). Calculate C as 'C = N - (A * B)' and check if C is a positive integer. If C is positive, increment the 'count' variable by 1. Continue the loops until all possible values of A and B have been checked. Return the value of 'count' as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles the input constraints where 2 <= N <= 10^6. Output the result as an integer representing the number of valid tuples (A, B, C).
