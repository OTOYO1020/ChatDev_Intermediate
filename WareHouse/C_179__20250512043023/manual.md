# Tuple Counting Application

A simple application to count valid tuples (A, B, C) such that A * B + C = N, where N is a positive integer.

## Main Functions

The Tuple Counting Application provides the following main functionalities:

- **Count Tuples**: The core function `count_tuples(N: int) -> int` calculates the number of valid tuples (A, B, C) for a given positive integer N.
- **User Input**: The application prompts the user to input a positive integer N, ensuring it falls within the specified range (2 <= N <= 10^6).
- **Output**: The application outputs the total count of valid tuples based on the input provided.

## Installation

To run the Tuple Counting Application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv tuple_counting_env
   source tuple_counting_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `tuple_counting_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the application code to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input a Positive Integer**: When prompted, enter a positive integer N within the range of 2 to 10^6.
   ```
   Enter a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 10^6):
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After entering a valid integer, the application will calculate and display the number of valid tuples (A, B, C).
   ```
   Number of valid tuples (A, B, C): <count>
   ```

## Example Usage

- **Input**: If you input `6`, the application will calculate and display the number of valid tuples for N = 6.
- **Output**: The output might look like:
  ```
  Number of valid tuples (A, B, C): 8
  ```

## Error Handling

- If the input is not a valid integer or falls outside the specified range, the application will display an error message:
  ```
  Input Error: N must be between 2 and 10^6.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Tuple Counting Application is a straightforward tool for counting valid tuples based on the mathematical condition A * B + C = N. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, handling inputs within the specified constraints.
