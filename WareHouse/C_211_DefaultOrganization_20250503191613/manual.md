# Chokudai Counting Application

This application counts the number of ways to form the string "chokudai" from a given input string. It utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.

## Main Functions

- **Count Occurrences**: The primary function of this application is to read an input string and calculate how many distinct ways the string "chokudai" can be formed using characters from the input string.
- **Dynamic Programming**: The application employs a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the number of ways to form each prefix of the target string.

## Installation

To run the chokudai counting application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using pip. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (currently empty, but can be updated in the future):

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input String**: When prompted, enter the input string from which you want to form "chokudai". Make sure to trim any leading or trailing whitespace.

4. **View Result**: After processing the input, the application will output the number of distinct ways to form the string "chokudai".

### Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter the input string: chchokudai
Output: 4
```

In this example, the input string "chchokudai" can form "chokudai" in 4 distinct ways.
