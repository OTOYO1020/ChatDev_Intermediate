Task:
Read the input string 'S' from standard input. Initialize a variable 'target' with the string chokudai. Initialize a variable 'mod' with the value \(10^9 + 7\). Create an array 'dp' of size 9 (to store counts for each prefix of 'target'), initialized to zeros, and set 'dp[0] = 1' (base case). Iterate through each character 'char' in the string 'S':\n   - For each character, check if it matches any character in 'target'.\n   - If it matches 'target[j]', update 'dp[j + 1]' as 'dp[j + 1] = (dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % mod'. After processing all characters in 'S', the result will be stored in 'dp[8]', which represents the number of ways to form the string chokudai. Print the result stored in 'dp[8]'.
