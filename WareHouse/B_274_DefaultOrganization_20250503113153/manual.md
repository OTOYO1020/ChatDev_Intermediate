# Box Counter

A simple application for counting boxes represented by '#' in a grid of specified dimensions.

## Main Functions

The Box Counter application allows users to:
- Input the dimensions of a grid (number of rows and columns).
- Enter grid data consisting of '#' for boxes and '.' for empty spaces.
- Count the number of boxes in each column of the grid.
- Display the results as space-separated integers.

## Installation

To run the Box Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary packages (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Note: The current implementation does not have external dependencies, but this command is included for future use.

## Usage

To use the Box Counter application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the application files are located and run the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Grid Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the number of rows (H) and columns (W) in the grid, separated by a space. For example:
   ```
   Enter number of rows (H) and columns (W): 3 4
   ```

3. **Input Grid Data**: You will be prompted to enter the grid data row by row. Each row must contain exactly W characters, using '#' for boxes and '.' for empty spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter the grid row by row (use '#' for boxes and '.' for empty spaces):
   Enter row 1 (exactly 4 characters, only '#' and '.'): #..#
   Enter row 2 (exactly 4 characters, only '#' and '.'): ..#.
   Enter row 3 (exactly 4 characters, only '#' and '.'): #..#
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering all rows, the application will process the data and display the counts of boxes in each column:
   ```
   Box counts: 2 1 0 1
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to ensure valid input:
- If the dimensions (H and W) are not positive integers, an error message will prompt you to re-enter.
- Each row must contain exactly W characters and can only include '#' and '.'. If invalid input is detected, you will be asked to re-enter the row.

## Future Enhancements

The `excel_handler.py` module is included for potential future enhancements, allowing for reading from and writing to Excel files. This feature can be developed to enable users to import grid data from Excel spreadsheets or export results for further analysis.
