Read integers H and W from standard input, representing the number of rows and columns in the grid. Initialize a list 'X' of size W with all elements set to 0 to store the count of boxes in each column. Loop through each row 'i' from 1 to H:\n   - For each column 'j' from 1 to W, read the character 'C[i][j]' from standard input.\n   - If 'C[i][j]' is '#', increment 'X[j-1]' (the count for the j-th column). After processing all rows, 'X' will contain the counts of boxes for each column. Print the values in the list 'X' as space-separated integers.
