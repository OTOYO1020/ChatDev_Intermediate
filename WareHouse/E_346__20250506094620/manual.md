# Color Grid Application

The Color Grid Application allows users to manipulate a grid of colors through a series of operations. Users can repaint entire rows or columns with specified colors and then view the counts of each color present in the grid.

## Main Functions

- **Initialize Grid**: Create a grid of size H x W, initially filled with color 0.
- **Repaint Operations**: Users can repaint either an entire row or an entire column with a specified color.
- **Count Colors**: After performing the operations, the application counts how many cells are painted with each color and displays the results.

## Installation

To run the Color Grid Application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application requires the following Python libraries:

- `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the `main.py` file to launch the Color Grid Application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Grid Dimensions**:
   - In the application window, enter the dimensions of the grid (H and W) and the number of operations (M) as a comma-separated string. For example: `5, 5, 3`.

3. **Input Operations**:
   - Below the grid dimensions input, you will find a text area. Enter the operations in the format `T A X`, where:
     - `T` is the type of operation (1 for row, 2 for column).
     - `A` is the index of the row or column to repaint (1-based index).
     - `X` is the color to apply.
   - Each operation should be on a new line. For example:
     ```
     1 1 3
     2 2 5
     1 3 2
     ```

4. **Run Operations**:
   - Click the "Run" button to process the operations. The application will validate the input and display an error message if there are any issues.

5. **View Results**:
   - After processing, a new window will pop up displaying the counts of each color in the grid. The results will be shown in ascending order of color.

## Example Usage

1. **Input**:
   ```
   4, 4, 3
   1 1 2
   2 2 3
   1 3 1
   ```

2. **Output**:
   ```
   Color 1: 4
   Color 2: 4
   Color 3: 4
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: Ensure that the grid dimensions and operations are correctly formatted. The application will provide error messages for invalid inputs.
- **No Output**: If the application does not display any results, check if the operations were entered correctly and if the number of operations matches M.

## Conclusion

The Color Grid Application provides a simple and interactive way to manipulate a grid of colors through user-defined operations. Enjoy experimenting with different grid sizes and color combinations!
