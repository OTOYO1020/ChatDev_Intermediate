# Integer Finder

A Python application to find the smallest integer X such that X can be expressed in the form of a polynomial involving non-negative integers a and b.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this software is to determine the smallest integer X for a given integer N, where:

- **Input**: An integer N (0 <= N <= 10^18).
- **Output**: The smallest integer X such that X = a^3 + a^2 * b + a * b^2 + b^3 for non-negative integers a and b.

## Features

- Validates the input to ensure it falls within the specified range.
- Efficiently searches for pairs (a, b) using a polynomial equation.
- Handles errors gracefully and provides feedback for invalid inputs.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Run the application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input an integer**:
   When prompted, enter an integer N within the range of 0 to 10^18. For example:
   ```
   Enter an integer N (0 <= N <= 10^18): 10
   ```

3. **View the result**:
   The application will output the smallest integer X that satisfies the condition. For example:
   ```
   Smallest Integer X: 10
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the input is not a valid integer, the application will display:
  ```
  Input Error: Please enter a valid integer.
  ```

- If the input integer N is out of the specified range, the application will raise a ValueError:
  ```
  Error: N must be in the range 0 <= N <= 10^18.
  ```

- If no valid integer is found within the iteration limit, the application will raise a RuntimeError:
  ```
  Error: No valid integer found within the iteration limit.
  ```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to find the smallest integer that meets specific polynomial criteria. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for both casual users and developers looking for a reliable solution.
