Task:
Read integers A and B from standard input, representing the coordinates of point Y. Calculate the distance from point (0, 0) to point (A, B) using the formula 'distance = sqrt(A^2 + B^2)'. Normalize the vector from (0, 0) to (A, B) to find the unit vector: 'unit_vector_x = A / distance' and 'unit_vector_y = B / distance'. Multiply the unit vector by the distance of 1 to find the new coordinates after moving: 'new_x = unit_vector_x * 1' and 'new_y = unit_vector_y * 1'. Round the new coordinates to the nearest integer values: 'final_x = round(new_x)' and 'final_y = round(new_y)'. Print the final coordinates (final_x, final_y) as the output.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly compute the new position after moving from the origin towards the point (A, B) by a distance of 1.
