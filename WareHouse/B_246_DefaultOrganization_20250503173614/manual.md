# Coordinate Calculator

A simple application for calculating new coordinates based on user-provided integer values representing a point in a 2D space.

## Main Functions

The Coordinate Calculator provides the following main functions:

1. **Calculate Distance**: Computes the distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point (A, B) using the formula:
   \[
   \text{distance} = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}
   \]

2. **Normalize Vector**: Normalizes the vector from the origin to the point (A, B) to find the unit vector:
   \[
   \text{unit\_vector\_x} = \frac{A}{\text{distance}}, \quad \text{unit\_vector\_y} = \frac{B}{\text{distance}}
   \]

3. **Get New Coordinates**: Moves from the origin towards the point (A, B) by a distance of 1 and rounds the new coordinates to the nearest integers.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   math
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Coordinates**:
   When prompted, enter integer values for A (x-coordinate) and B (y-coordinate). For example:
   ```
   Enter an integer value for A (x-coordinate): 3
   Enter an integer value for B (y-coordinate): 4
   ```

3. **View Output**:
   The application will calculate and display the final coordinates after moving from the origin towards the point (A, B) by a distance of 1. The output will look like:
   ```
   Final Coordinates: (1, 1)
   ```

## Error Handling

- If you enter non-integer values, the application will display an error message:
  ```
  Error: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'. Please enter valid integer coordinates.
  ```

- If you enter the coordinates (0, 0), the application will return:
  ```
  The coordinates (0, 0) do not represent a valid direction. Returning (0, 0) as default.
  Final Coordinates: (0, 0)
  ```

## Future Enhancements

This application is designed to be extensible. Future enhancements may include:

- Support for floating-point coordinates.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Additional vector operations and transformations.

For any questions or support, please reach out to our development team.
