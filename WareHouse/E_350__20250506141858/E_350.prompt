Read the integer values of N, A, X, and Y from standard input. Initialize a variable 'min_cost' to store the minimum expected cost, starting at infinity. Define a recursive function 'calculate_cost(N)' that computes the minimum cost for a given N. In 'calculate_cost(N)', check if N is 0; if so, return 0 (base case). Calculate the cost of the first operation: \n   - Compute 'cost_A = X + calculate_cost(⌊N/A⌋)'. Initialize a variable 'cost_dice' to store the expected cost of the second operation. Loop through possible die outcomes (b = 1 to 6):\n   - For each b, compute 'cost_b = Y + calculate_cost(⌊N/b⌋)'.\n   - Update 'cost_dice' with the average of all costs from the die rolls. Update 'min_cost' with the minimum of 'cost_A' and 'cost_dice'. Return 'min_cost' from 'calculate_cost(N)'. Print the final value of 'min_cost' as the minimum expected cost.
