Read integers N and M from standard input. Initialize a list to store the connections of each bulb to the switches. For each bulb (from 1 to M):Read the number of connected switches \( k_i \),Read the \( k_i \) switch indices and store them in the list,Read the required parity \( p_i \) for the bulb. Generate all possible combinations of on and off states for the N switches (total \( 2^N \) combinations). For each combination of switch states: Initialize a counter for each bulb to track the number of on switches. For each bulb, check the states of its connected switches and count how many are on. Check if the count of on switches matches the required parity \( p_i \). Count the number of combinations that light all bulbs. Print the total count of valid combinations.
