Define a function 'maximize_min_deliciousness(N: int, A: List[int], C: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the number of bean types, 'A' is a list of deliciousness values, and 'C' is a list of corresponding colors. Create a data structure (e.g., a dictionary) to group the deliciousness values by their respective colors. Iterate through the list of colors and for each color, find the minimum deliciousness value among the beans of that color. Keep track of the maximum of these minimum deliciousness values across all colors. Implement error handling to ensure that the input values meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ N ≤ 200,000, 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 1,000,000,000, 1 ≤ C_i ≤ 1,000,000,000). Optimize the algorithm to ensure it runs efficiently within the constraints, possibly using sorting or a priority queue. Test the function with various test cases, including edge cases such as all beans having the same color or deliciousness. Document the function with comments explaining the logic and the expected input/output formats. Ensure the function returns the correct maximum minimum deliciousness value as an integer. Output the result in the specified format, ensuring it is a single integer representing the maximum minimum deliciousness.
