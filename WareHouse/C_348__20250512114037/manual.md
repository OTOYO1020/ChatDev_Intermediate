Here's the `manual.md` file for the software that implements the function `maximize_min_deliciousness`. This manual provides a comprehensive guide on how to install the necessary dependencies, use the software, and understand its main functions.

```markdown
# Maximize Minimum Deliciousness

A Python application designed to compute the maximum minimum deliciousness of beans based on their deliciousness values and corresponding colors.

## Quick Install

To install the required dependencies, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.

## 🤔 What is this?

This software provides a function that takes in the number of bean types, their deliciousness values, and their colors. It groups the deliciousness values by color and computes the maximum of the minimum deliciousness values across all colors. This can be particularly useful for applications in food technology, culinary arts, and product development where flavor profiling is essential.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input values meet the specified constraints:
   - `1 ≤ N ≤ 200,000`
   - `1 ≤ A_i ≤ 1,000,000,000`
   - `1 ≤ C_i ≤ 1,000,000,000`

2. **Maximize Minimum Deliciousness**: The core function `maximize_min_deliciousness(N: int, A: List[int], C: List[int]) -> int` performs the following:
   - Groups deliciousness values by their respective colors.
   - Finds the minimum deliciousness value for each color.
   - Returns the maximum of these minimum values.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**:
   - You will be prompted to enter the number of bean types (N).
   - Enter the deliciousness values (A) separated by commas.
   - Enter the colors (C) separated by commas.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of bean types (N): 5
   Enter the deliciousness values (A) separated by commas: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
   Enter the colors (C) separated by commas: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - The application will output the maximum minimum deliciousness value based on the provided inputs.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Max Min Deliciousness: 30
   ```

## 🛠️ Error Handling

The application includes error handling to manage invalid inputs. If the input values do not meet the specified constraints, an error message will be displayed.

## 🧪 Testing

The function has been tested with various test cases, including edge cases such as:
- All beans having the same color.
- All beans having the same deliciousness value.
- Different distributions of colors and deliciousness values.

## Conclusion

This software provides a robust solution for calculating the maximum minimum deliciousness of beans based on their deliciousness and color attributes. For further inquiries or support, please contact our development team.
