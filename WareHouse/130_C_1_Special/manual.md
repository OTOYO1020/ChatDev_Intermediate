# Rectangle Area Calculator

A simple tool for calculating the maximum possible area of a rectangle when divided by a point.

## Main Functions

The Rectangle Area Calculator provides the following functionalities:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads the dimensions of the rectangle (width and height) and the coordinates of a point within the rectangle.
2. **Total Area Calculation**: Computes the total area of the rectangle using the formula `total_area = W * H`.
3. **Maximum Possible Area Calculation**: Determines the maximum possible area of the smaller part when the rectangle is divided by a line through the specified point.
4. **Multiple Ways Check**: Checks if there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum area, specifically if the point is at the center of the rectangle.
5. **Output**: Prints the maximum area and indicates whether there are multiple ways to achieve it.

## Installation

To run the Rectangle Area Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rectangle-area-calculator.git
   cd rectangle-area-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**: 
   You can install any necessary dependencies using pip. However, this project does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: You can run the program from the command line. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter four integers separated by spaces:
   - `W`: Width of the rectangle
   - `H`: Height of the rectangle
   - `x`: x-coordinate of the point
   - `y`: y-coordinate of the point

   Example input:
   ```
   10 5 5 2
   ```

3. **Output**: The program will output the maximum possible area of the smaller part and whether there are multiple ways to achieve that area.
   - Example output:
   ```
   25.0 0
   ```

   In this example, `25.0` is the maximum area, and `0` indicates that there are no multiple ways to achieve this area.

## Example Usage

To see the program in action, you can use the following example:

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input:
   ```
   8 4 4 2
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   16.0 0
   ```

## Conclusion

The Rectangle Area Calculator is a straightforward tool designed to help users compute areas based on rectangle dimensions and point coordinates. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
