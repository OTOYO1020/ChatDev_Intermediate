Read integers X, Y, A, and B from standard input. Initialize 'STR' with value X and 'EXP' with value 0. Create a loop to simulate training without letting Takahashi evolve:\n   - While 'STR' is less than Y:\n     - Calculate the potential new STR after going to Kakomon Gym: 'new_STR_kakomon = STR * A'.\n     - Calculate the potential new STR after going to AtCoder Gym: 'new_STR_atcoder = STR + B'.\n     - Compare 'new_STR_kakomon' and 'new_STR_atcoder' to determine which training option keeps 'STR' below Y while maximizing EXP.\n     - If 'new_STR_kakomon' is less than Y and greater than 'new_STR_atcoder', update 'STR' to 'new_STR_kakomon' and increment 'EXP' by 1.\n     - Else if 'new_STR_atcoder' is less than Y, update 'STR' to 'new_STR_atcoder' and increment 'EXP' by 1.\n     - If neither option is valid (both would cause evolution), break the loop. Print the final value of 'EXP'.
