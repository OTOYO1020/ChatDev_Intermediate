# Bounce Calculator

A simple application to calculate bounce coordinates and count valid bounces based on user input.

## Main Functions

The Bounce Calculator consists of the following main functions:

1. **parse_input()**: Handles the input format by reading integers `N`, a list of integers `L`, and an integer `X`.
2. **initialize_variables()**: Initializes the bounce coordinate array `D` with `D[0] = 0`.
3. **calculate_bounce_coordinates(N, L)**: Computes the bounce coordinates using the formula `D[i] = D[i-1] + L[i-1]`.
4. **count_valid_bounces(D, X)**: Counts how many bounce coordinates are less than or equal to `X`.
5. **get_result()**: Returns the count of valid bounces and prints the result.

## Installation

To run the Bounce Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

No additional dependencies are required for this application. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Bounce Calculator

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the Bounce Calculator code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the following:
   - An integer `N` (the number of bounce coordinates).
   - A list of integers `L` (comma-separated values representing the bounce distances).
   - An integer `X` (the threshold value to count valid bounces).

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter N: 5
   Enter list of integers (comma-separated): 1,2,3,4,5
   Enter X: 10
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the inputs, the application will calculate and display the number of valid bounces.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Valid Bounces: 4
   ```
