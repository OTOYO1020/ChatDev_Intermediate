Task:
Define the function 'is_good_pair(N: int, M: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> str' to check if the pair of sequences (A, B) is a good pair. Parse the input to extract the values of N, M, and the sequences A and B from the input format. Initialize a list 'X' of length N with all elements set to -1 to represent unassigned values. Iterate through each index i from 0 to M-1 and check the conditions for the sequences A and B. For each pair (A[i], B[i]), if X[A[i]-1] is -1, assign it a value (0 or 1) based on the current state of X[B[i]-1]. If X[B[i]-1] is already assigned, ensure that it is different from X[A[i]-1]. If not, return 'No'. Continue this process for all pairs (A[i], B[i]) to determine if a valid sequence X can be constructed. If all pairs satisfy the conditions, return 'Yes'. Handle edge cases where M or N are at their minimum or maximum limits. Output the result as 'Yes' or 'No' based on the evaluation of the sequences.
