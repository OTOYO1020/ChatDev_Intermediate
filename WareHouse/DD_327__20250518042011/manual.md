# Good Pair Checker

A simple application to determine if two sequences form a "good pair" based on specific conditions.

## Overview

The Good Pair Checker allows users to input two sequences of integers and checks if they can be assigned values such that no two connected integers have the same value. This is useful in various applications, such as graph coloring problems.

## Main Functions

- **is_good_pair(N: int, M: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> str**: 
  - This function checks if the sequences A and B form a good pair based on the defined conditions. It returns 'Yes' if they can be assigned values according to the rules, and 'No' otherwise.

## Installation

To run the Good Pair Checker, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## How to Use the Good Pair Checker

### Step 1: Run the Application

To run the application, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Input Format

When prompted, enter the values for N, M, A, and B in a single line, separated by spaces. The input format is as follows:

- **N**: Total number of elements (1 ≤ N)
- **M**: Number of pairs (0 ≤ M ≤ N)
- **A**: List of integers representing the first sequence (length M)
- **B**: List of integers representing the second sequence (length M)

**Example Input:**

```
5 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5
```

### Step 3: Interpret the Output

After entering the input, the application will evaluate the sequences and print either 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether the sequences form a good pair.

**Example Output:**

```
Yes
```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to ensure that:

- M is a non-negative integer and does not exceed N.
- A and B contain exactly M elements.
- Values in A and B are between 1 and N.

If any of these conditions are not met, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

## Edge Cases

- If M is 0, the application will return 'Yes' as there are no pairs to evaluate.
- If N is less than 1, the application will return 'No'.

## Conclusion

The Good Pair Checker is a straightforward tool for evaluating pairs of sequences. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily determine if their sequences meet the criteria for being a good pair.
