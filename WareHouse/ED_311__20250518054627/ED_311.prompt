Define the function 'count_holeless_squares(H: int, W: int, N: int, holed_squares: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int' to encapsulate the solution. Parse the input to extract integers H, W, N, and a list of tuples representing holed squares from the input format. Initialize a 2D grid of size H x W to represent the grid and mark the holed squares based on the input list. Implement a nested loop to iterate over all possible top-left corners (i, j) of potential holeless squares. For each top-left corner (i, j), implement a check to determine the maximum size n of the holeless square that can start at (i, j). For each size n, check if the square defined by (i, j) and size n is holeless by verifying all contained squares are not holed. Count the number of valid holeless squares found during the iterations and checks. Return the total count of holeless squares from the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when N is 0 or when the grid is fully holed. Output the result as an integer representing the total number of holeless squares.
