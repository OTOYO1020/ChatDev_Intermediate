# Takahashi Game

Welcome to the Takahashi Game, a fun word-based game where players take turns using words from the Takahashi Dictionary. The goal is to outsmart your opponent by strategically choosing words based on the last three characters of the current word.

## Main Functions

The software consists of several key functions:

1. **load_words(N)**: Reads N words from user input, ensuring each word is between 3 and 8 characters long.
2. **can_play(word, words)**: Checks if a player can continue the game after a given word by finding all valid words that start with the last three characters of the current word.
3. **play_game(current_word, words, visited)**: Simulates the game, determining the winner based on the current word and the words that have been visited.
4. **display_results(results)**: Displays the results of the game, indicating whether Takahashi or Aoki wins for each starting word.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Takahashi Game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
