Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of words in the Takahashi Dictionary. Read N words into a list 'words' from standard input, ensuring each word is between 3 and 8 characters long. Create a function 'can_play(word, words)' that checks if a player can continue the game after a given word by finding all valid words that start with the last three characters of the current word. Implement a recursive function 'play_game(current_word, words, visited)' that simulates the game:\n   - Mark the current word as visited.\n   - Check if the next player can play using 'can_play(last_three_chars, words)'.\n   - If the next player cannot play, return the result indicating the current player wins. For each word in 'words', call 'play_game(s_i, words, set())' to determine the winner when Takahashi starts with that word. Store the results of each game in a list 'results', indicating whether Takahashi or Aoki wins for each starting word. Print the results for each starting word in the order they were provided.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output will be a list of strings, where each string indicates the winner (Takahashi or Aoki) for the corresponding starting word.
