# Palindrome Checker

A simple application to check for palindromic concatenations of distinct strings.

## Quick Install

To run the Palindrome Checker, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can set up the environment by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   Currently, there are no external dependencies required for this application. It uses built-in Python functionalities.

## ü§î What is this?

The Palindrome Checker application reads a specified number of distinct strings and checks if any concatenation of two different strings forms a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   To start the application, navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - First, input an integer `N`, which represents the number of strings you will provide.
   - Next, input `N` distinct strings, one per line.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   3
   race
   car
   hello
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - The application will output `YES` if any concatenation of the provided strings forms a palindrome.
   - If no palindromic concatenation is found, it will output `NO`.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   YES
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure

The application consists of two main files:

1. **main.py**: The main application file that handles user input, string concatenation, and palindrome checking.
2. **palindrome_checker.py**: A module containing the `is_palindrome` function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

### main.py
```python
'''
Main application file for the Palindrome Checker.
'''
from palindrome_checker import is_palindrome

def main():
    n = int(input())  # Read number of strings from standard input
    strings = []
    for i in range(n):
        string = input()  # Read each string from standard input
        strings.append(string)
    found_palindrome = False
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):  # Start j from i + 1 to avoid checking the same pair twice
            concat_str1 = strings[i] + strings[j]  # Concatenate strings
            concat_str2 = strings[j] + strings[i]  # Also check the reverse concatenation
            if is_palindrome(concat_str1) or is_palindrome(concat_str2):
                found_palindrome = True
                break
        if found_palindrome:
            break
    if found_palindrome:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### palindrome_checker.py
```python
'''
Module containing the function to check if a string is a palindrome.
'''
def is_palindrome(concat_str):
    '''
    Check if the given string is a palindrome.
    '''
    return concat_str == concat_str[::-1]
```

## üìù Notes

- Ensure that the strings you provide are distinct; the application does not handle duplicates.
- The application is designed for simplicity and clarity, making it easy to understand and modify as needed.
