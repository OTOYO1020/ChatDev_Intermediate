Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of strings. Initialize an empty list 'strings' to store the N distinct strings. Read N strings 'S_i' from standard input and append each to the 'strings' list. Create a function 'is_palindrome(concat_str)' that checks if the concatenated string 'concat_str' is a palindrome. Use nested loops to iterate over all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N and i ≠ j. For each pair (i, j), concatenate 'strings[i-1]' and 'strings[j-1]' to form 'concat_str'. Call 'is_palindrome(concat_str)' to check if the concatenated string is a palindrome. If a palindrome is found, print 'YES' and exit the loop. If no palindrome is found after checking all pairs, print 'NO'. Ensure that the output is formatted correctly as either 'YES' or 'NO'.
