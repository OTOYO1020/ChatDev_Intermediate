Read integers H and W from standard input, representing the dimensions of the chocolate bar. Read the H x W matrix S, where each element S[i][j] is either '0' (dark) or '1' (white). Initialize a variable 'cut_count' to 0 to keep track of the number of cuts needed. Create a variable 'current_white_count' to count the number of white squares in the current block. Iterate over each row of the chocolate bar:\n   - For each row, iterate over each column:\n     - If S[i][j] is '1', increment 'current_white_count'.\n     - If 'current_white_count' exceeds K:\n       - Increment 'cut_count' by 1.\n       - Reset 'current_white_count' to the current square's value (either 0 or 1). After processing all columns in a row, check if 'current_white_count' exceeds K and increment 'cut_count' if necessary. Repeat the process for each subsequent row, ensuring to account for cuts between rows as well. Print the total number of cuts needed ('cut_count').\n\nOutput format: The output should be a single integer representing the number of cuts required.
