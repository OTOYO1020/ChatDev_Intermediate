# Takahashi Travel Application

A travel planning application that calculates the shortest time for Takahashi to visit a series of towns and collect accelerators from chests.

## Main Functions

The Takahashi Travel application provides the following main functionalities:

1. **Calculate Shortest Time**: Computes the shortest time required for Takahashi to travel through a specified number of towns and collect accelerators from chests, if available.

2. **Input Handling**: Accepts user input for the number of towns and chests, as well as their respective coordinates in a 2D plane.

3. **Distance Calculation**: Utilizes Euclidean distance to determine travel distances between towns, chests, and the origin.

4. **Route Permutations**: Generates all possible routes Takahashi can take to visit the towns, ensuring all potential paths are evaluated.

5. **Chest Evaluation**: Implements logic to decide whether to visit chests based on current speed and potential time savings from picking up accelerators.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Travel application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You may need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install itertools
```

This library is included in Python's standard library, so no additional installation is typically required.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Number of Towns and Chests**: When prompted, enter the number of towns (N) and the number of chests (M).

   ```
   Enter the number of towns: 3
   Enter the number of chests: 2
   ```

3. **Input Coordinates**: For each town and chest, enter their coordinates in the format `x y`.

   ```
   Enter coordinates for town 1 (x y): 1 2
   Enter coordinates for town 2 (x y): 3 4
   Enter coordinates for town 3 (x y): 5 6
   Enter coordinates for chest 1 (x y): 2 3
   Enter coordinates for chest 2 (x y): 4 5
   ```

4. **View Results**: The application will calculate the shortest time for Takahashi's trip and display the result.

   ```
   Shortest Time: 10.50
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application.
2. Input the number of towns and chests.
3. Provide the coordinates for each town and chest.
4. Receive the calculated shortest time for the trip.

## Testing and Validation

The application has been tested with various test cases to ensure correctness and handle edge cases, such as when there are no chests (M = 0).

## Conclusion

The Takahashi Travel application is a powerful tool for planning efficient travel routes while considering the benefits of collecting accelerators. By following the instructions above, users can easily calculate the shortest travel times for their trips.
