Define a function named 'find_permutation' that takes an integer N and a list of integers P as arguments. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list P from standard input. Validate that the length of P is equal to N and that P is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to N. Initialize a list Q of length N with default values. Iterate through each index i from 1 to N and set Q[P[i-1] - 1] to i. Ensure that the assignment of values to Q is done correctly based on the condition specified in the problem statement. After populating the list Q, prepare it for output by converting it to the required format. Implement output handling to print the list Q as space-separated integers. Test the function with various edge cases to ensure correctness, including minimum and maximum values of N. Document the function and its parameters for clarity and maintainability.
