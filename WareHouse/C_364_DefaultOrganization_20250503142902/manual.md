# Dish Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum number of dishes that can be eaten without exceeding specified sweetness and saltiness limits.

## Main Functions

The Dish Calculator provides the following main functionalities:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - Prompts the user to enter the number of dishes, sweetness limit, saltiness limit, and the respective sweetness and saltiness values for each dish.
   - Validates the input to ensure that the lengths of sweetness and saltiness arrays match the number of dishes.

2. **Dish Calculation**:
   - Creates a list of tuples containing pairs of sweetness and saltiness values.
   - Sorts the dishes based on a custom heuristic that considers both sweetness and saltiness.
   - Iterates through the sorted list to calculate the total sweetness and saltiness consumed, stopping when the limits are exceeded.

3. **Output**:
   - Returns and prints the minimum number of dishes that can be eaten without exceeding the specified limits.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Dish Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (if not already provided):
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```

   Then install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Dish Calculator

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Required Values**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of dishes (N).
   - Enter the sweetness limit (X).
   - Enter the saltiness limit (Y).
   - Provide the sweetness values as a comma-separated list.
   - Provide the saltiness values as a comma-separated list.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of dishes (N): 5
   Enter the sweetness limit (X): 10
   Enter the saltiness limit (Y): 15
   Enter sweetness values (comma-separated): 2,3,5,1,4
   Enter saltiness values (comma-separated): 1,2,3,4,5
   ```

3. **View the Result**:
   After entering the values, the application will calculate and print the minimum number of dishes that can be eaten without exceeding the specified limits.

## Future Enhancements

This application can be further enhanced by:
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Implementing additional sorting heuristics.
- Allowing for more complex dish attributes and constraints.
