Read integers N, X, and Y from standard input. Read the arrays A (sweetness values) and B (saltiness values) of length N. Create a list of tuples 'dishes' containing pairs of (A_i, B_i) for each dish. Sort the 'dishes' list based on a suitable heuristic (e.g., by sweetness or saltiness). Initialize variables 'total_sweetness = 0', 'total_saltiness = 0', and 'count = 0'. Iterate through the sorted 'dishes' list:\n   - For each dish, add its sweetness and saltiness to 'total_sweetness' and 'total_saltiness'.\n   - Increment 'count' by 1.\n   - Check if 'total_sweetness' exceeds X or 'total_saltiness' exceeds Y; if so, break the loop. Return the value of 'count' as the minimum number of dishes eaten. Print the result.
