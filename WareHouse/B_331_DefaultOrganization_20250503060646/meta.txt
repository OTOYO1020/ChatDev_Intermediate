Task:
Read integers N, S, M, and L from standard input, where N is the number of eggs needed, and S, M, L are the costs of the egg packs. Initialize a variable 'min_cost' to a large value (e.g., infinity) to keep track of the minimum cost found. Loop through all possible combinations of packs of 6, 8, and 12 eggs:\n   - For each possible number of 6-egg packs (from 0 to N // 6):\n     - For each possible number of 8-egg packs (from 0 to (N - 6 * number_of_6_packs) // 8):\n       - Calculate the remaining eggs needed after using the 6 and 8-egg packs.\n       - If remaining eggs can be fulfilled by 12-egg packs, calculate the total cost.\n       - Update 'min_cost' if the calculated cost is lower than the current 'min_cost'. After checking all combinations, ensure to account for any remaining eggs that may require additional packs. Print the value of 'min_cost' as the minimum amount of money required to purchase at least N eggs.
