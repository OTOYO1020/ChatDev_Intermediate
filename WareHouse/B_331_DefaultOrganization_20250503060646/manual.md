# Egg Cost Calculator

An application designed to calculate the minimum cost of purchasing egg packs based on user-defined requirements.

## Overview

The Egg Cost Calculator allows users to input the number of eggs needed and the costs of different egg pack sizes (6, 8, and 12 eggs). The application then computes the minimum cost required to purchase at least the specified number of eggs by evaluating all possible combinations of the available packs.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts users to enter the number of eggs needed and the costs of the egg packs.
- **Cost Calculation**: It calculates the minimum cost by exploring all combinations of 6-egg, 8-egg, and 12-egg packs.
- **Output**: Displays the minimum cost or informs the user if fulfilling the order is not possible.

## Installation

To run the Egg Cost Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install any future dependencies as needed.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the following:
   - The number of eggs needed (N).
   - The cost of a 6-egg pack (S).
   - The cost of an 8-egg pack (M).
   - The cost of a 12-egg pack (L).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the number of eggs needed: 20
   Enter the cost of 6-egg pack: 5
   Enter the cost of 8-egg pack: 7
   Enter the cost of 12-egg pack: 10
   ```

3. **View Results**: After processing the input, the application will display the minimum cost required to purchase the eggs or indicate if it's not possible to fulfill the order.

   Example output:
   ```
   Minimum Cost: 15
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the user inputs invalid integers, the application will prompt them to enter valid integers.
- If it is not possible to fulfill the order with the given pack sizes and quantities, the application will inform the user accordingly.

## Future Enhancements

The application is designed to be extensible. Future enhancements may include:
- Adding more pack sizes.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Providing options for bulk purchasing or discounts.

## Support

For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team via the support channel.
