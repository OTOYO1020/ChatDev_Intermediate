# Minimum Operations to Create K Consecutive 'o's

This application calculates the minimum number of operations required to create K consecutive 'o's in a given grid of characters. The grid consists of 'o's and '.'s, where '.' can be converted to 'o' through operations.

## Main Functions

- **min_operations_to_consecutive_o(H: int, W: int, K: int, S: List[str]) -> int**: This function takes the height (H), width (W), the number of consecutive 'o's required (K), and the grid (S) as input. It returns the minimum number of operations needed to achieve K consecutive 'o's either horizontally or vertically, or -1 if it is not possible.

## Installation

This project does not rely on any external libraries. To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The minimum required Python version is 3.6.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly run the application with Python.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Parameters**:
   - The application will prompt you to enter the height (H) of the grid.
   - Next, enter the width (W) of the grid.
   - Then, specify the number of consecutive 'o's (K) you want to achieve.
   - Finally, input the grid rows one by one. After entering all rows, press Enter on an empty line to finish input.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter Height (H): 4
   Enter Width (W): 5
   Enter Consecutive 'o's (K): 3
   Enter the grid rows (each row on a new line, end with an empty line):
   ..o..
   o....
   ....o
   o.o..
   ```

3. **View the Result**:
   After providing the input, the application will calculate and display the minimum number of operations required to create K consecutive 'o's.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Minimum Operations: 2
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the application:

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the following when prompted:
   ```
   Enter Height (H): 4
   Enter Width (W): 5
   Enter Consecutive 'o's (K): 3
   Enter the grid rows (each row on a new line, end with an empty line):
   ..o..
   o....
   ....o
   o.o..
   ```

3. The output will show:
   ```
   Minimum Operations: 2
   ```

## Conclusion

This application is a simple yet effective tool for determining the minimum operations needed to create K consecutive 'o's in a grid. It can be useful for various applications in game development, puzzle solving, and more.
