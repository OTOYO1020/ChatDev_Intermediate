Task:
Define the function 'min_operations_to_consecutive_o(H: int, W: int, K: int, S: List[str]) -> int' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract integers H, W, K and the list of strings S representing the grid. Initialize a variable 'min_operations' to a large value to keep track of the minimum operations required. Iterate through each row of the grid to check for horizontal sequences of K consecutive 'o's, counting the number of '.' that need to be changed to 'o'. For each row, if a valid horizontal sequence is found, update 'min_operations' with the minimum number of operations required. Iterate through each column of the grid to check for vertical sequences of K consecutive 'o's, counting the number of '.' that need to be changed to 'o'. For each column, if a valid vertical sequence is found, update 'min_operations' with the minimum number of operations required. After checking all rows and columns, determine if 'min_operations' was updated; if not, set it to -1 to indicate it's impossible. Return the value of 'min_operations' from the function. Ensure the output format is an integer representing the minimum number of operations or -1 if not possible.
