# Ball Combination Calculator

A simple application for calculating valid combinations of ball values from multiple bags to achieve a target product.

## Quick Install

To run the Ball Combination Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies if you plan to expand the project in the future.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Ball Combination Calculator allows users to input multiple bags of balls, each with specific values, and calculates how many combinations of these values can yield a specified target product. This application is useful for combinatorial problems and can be adapted for various scenarios involving products and combinations.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the number of bags, the number of balls in each bag, and the values of those balls.
2. **Combination Counting**: It uses a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of ball values across the bags to find those that match the target product.
3. **Output**: The application outputs the total number of valid combinations that meet the target product.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the required data:
   - Enter the number of bags (N).
   - For each bag, enter the number of balls and then the value of each ball.
   - Finally, enter the target product (X).

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of bags (N): 2
   Enter the number of balls in bag 1: 3
   Enter the value of ball 1 in bag 1: 1
   Enter the value of ball 2 in bag 1: 2
   Enter the value of ball 3 in bag 1: 3
   Enter the number of balls in bag 2: 2
   Enter the value of ball 1 in bag 2: 4
   Enter the value of ball 2 in bag 2: 5
   Enter the target product: 12
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will calculate and display the number of valid combinations that yield the target product.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Valid Combinations: 2
   ```
