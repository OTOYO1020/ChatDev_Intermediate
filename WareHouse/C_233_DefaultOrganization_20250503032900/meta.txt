Task:
Read the integer N (number of bags) from standard input. Initialize a list of lists 'bags' to store the balls in each bag. For each bag i from 1 to N:\n   - Read the integer L_i (number of balls in bag i).\n   - Initialize a list 'ball_values' to store the values of the balls in bag i.\n   - For each ball j from 1 to L_i:\n     - Read the integer a_{i,j} (value on the j-th ball in bag i) and append it to 'ball_values'.\n   - Append 'ball_values' to 'bags'. Read the integer X (the target product) from standard input. Initialize a variable 'count' to zero to keep track of the number of valid combinations. Implement a recursive function 'count_combinations(current_bag, current_product)':\n   - If 'current_bag' equals N (all bags processed):\n     - If 'current_product' equals X, increment 'count'.\n     - Return.\n   - For each ball value in 'bags[current_bag]':\n     - Call 'count_combinations(current_bag + 1, current_product * ball_value)' to explore further combinations. Call 'count_combinations(0, 1)' to start the recursive counting process. Print the final value of 'count' as the output.
