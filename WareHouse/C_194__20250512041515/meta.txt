Task:
Define a function 'sum_of_squared_differences(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' that takes an integer N and a list of integers A as input. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list A from standard input. Ensure that the length of list A is equal to N and that all elements of A are within the specified range (-200 to 200). Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to accumulate the sum of squared differences. Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N. For each pair (i, j), calculate the squared difference (A[i-1] - A[j-1])^2 and add it to 'total_sum'. After completing the nested loops, return the value of 'total_sum' as the output of the function. Implement error handling to manage cases where N is out of the specified bounds (2 ≤ N ≤ 300000). Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness and performance within the constraints. Output the final result of the sum of squared differences as an integer.
