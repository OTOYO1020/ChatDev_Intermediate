# Sum of Squared Differences Calculator

A simple Python application to calculate the sum of squared differences for a list of integers.

## Main Functions

The application consists of two main components:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `A` from standard input. It ensures that:
   - The length of list `A` is equal to `N`.
   - All elements of `A` are within the specified range of -200 to 200.
   - The value of `N` is within the bounds of 2 to 300,000.

2. **Calculation**: The function `sum_of_squared_differences(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int` computes the sum of squared differences for all pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N. The squared difference for each pair is calculated as (A[i-1] - A[j-1])^2 and accumulated into a total sum.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the number of elements (N) followed by the elements of the list (space-separated). For example:

   ```
   Enter the number of elements (N): 5
   Enter the elements (space-separated): 1 2 3 4 5
   ```

4. **View Result**: The application will output the sum of squared differences based on the input provided.

   ```
   Sum of Squared Differences: 40
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If `N` is not within the range of 2 to 300,000, an error message will be displayed.
- If the length of list `A` does not match `N` or if any element is outside the range of -200 to 200, an error message will be displayed.

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application.
2. Input the number of elements:

   ```
   Enter the number of elements (N): 4
   ```

3. Input the elements of the list:

   ```
   Enter the elements (space-separated): 10 -10 20 -20
   ```

4. The output will be:

   ```
   Sum of Squared Differences: 1600
   ```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to calculate the sum of squared differences for a list of integers. It is designed to handle input validation and error management effectively, ensuring a smooth user experience.
