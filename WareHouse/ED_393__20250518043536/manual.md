Here's a detailed user manual for the GCD calculator software, formatted in Markdown as requested:

# GCD Calculator

A Python application for calculating the maximum GCD from a list of integers based on user-defined parameters.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment for the GCD Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# requirements.txt
```

*Note: Currently, there are no external dependencies required beyond Python's standard library.*

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The GCD Calculator is designed to compute the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a list of integers based on a specified number of elements (K). The application allows users to input a sequence of integers and an integer K, and it will return the maximum GCD for each element in the sequence when combined with K-1 other elements.

### Main Functions

- **max_gcd_with_k_elements(A: List[int], K: int) -> List[int]**: This function takes a list of integers and an integer K, and returns a list of maximum GCDs for each element in the input list.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input Data**: Create a text file or prepare standard input with the following format:
   - The first line should contain a comma-separated list of integers (the sequence A).
   - The second line should contain the integer K.

   Example input:
   ```
   12,15,18,24
   2
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` from the command line. You can redirect input from a file or provide it directly through standard input.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

3. **View Results**: The application will output the maximum GCDs for each element in the sequence based on the specified K.

   Example output:
   ```
   Maximum GCDs: [6, 3, 6, 6]
   ```

## Edge Cases

- If K equals 1, the function will return the element itself as the maximum GCD.
- If all elements in the list are the same, the maximum GCD will also be that same value.
- If K is less than 1 or greater than the length of the sequence, a ValueError will be raised.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

For further details on how the GCD calculation works and the underlying logic, please refer to the code comments in `gcd_calculator.py` and `main.py`.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the GCD Calculator:

```bash
# Create an input file named input.txt with the following content:
# 12,15,18,24
# 2

# Run the application
python main.py < input.txt
```

This will output the maximum GCDs for the given sequence.
