Task:
Define the function 'max_gcd_with_k_elements(A: List[int], K: int) -> List[int]' to handle the input sequence and the integer K. Parse the input to extract the sequence A and the integer K. Implement a loop to iterate over each element A[i] in the sequence A. For each A[i], generate a list of K elements that includes A[i]. Calculate the GCD of the selected K elements for each combination that includes A[i]. Store the maximum GCD found for each A[i] in a results list. Optimize the GCD calculation to handle the constraints efficiently, considering the maximum values for N and A[i]. Return the results list containing the maximum GCD for each A[i]. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when K equals 1 or when all elements are the same. Format the output as a list of integers representing the maximum GCDs for each A[i].
