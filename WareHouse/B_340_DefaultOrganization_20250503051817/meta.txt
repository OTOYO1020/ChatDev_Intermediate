Task:
Read the integer Q from standard input, which represents the number of queries. Initialize an empty list 'A' to store the sequence. Loop through Q times to process each query:\n   - For each query, read the type and the associated value (either 'x' for type 1 or 'k' for type 2). If the query type is '1', append 'x' to the end of the list 'A' using 'A.append(x)'. If the query type is '2', retrieve the 'k'-th value from the end of the list 'A' using 'A[-k]'. Store the result of the 'k'-th value retrieval for output. After processing all queries, print the results for all type 2 queries, each on a new line.\n\nThis structure ensures that we handle the input and output formats correctly while maintaining clarity in the implementation steps.
