Task:
Define the function 'count_happy_paths(H: int, W: int, A: List[List[int]]) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting distinct paths. Implement input handling to read integers H and W, and a 2D list A representing the grid values. Create a helper function 'is_distinct_path(path: List[int]) -> bool' to check if the integers in the current path are distinct. Implement a recursive function 'find_paths(i: int, j: int, path: List[int])' to explore all possible paths from (i, j) to (H, W). In 'find_paths', add the current cell's value to the path and check if it remains distinct using 'is_distinct_path'. If the current position is (H, W), increment a counter for valid paths if the path is distinct. Ensure that the function does not go out of grid bounds when moving right or down. Use memoization to optimize the pathfinding process and avoid recalculating paths from the same position with the same path. Return the total count of valid paths from 'count_happy_paths'. Output the result in the required format after calling 'count_happy_paths'.
