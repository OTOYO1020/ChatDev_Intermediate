Define a function 'min_window_width(N: int, M: int, L: List[int]) -> int' to calculate the minimum possible width of the window. Parse the input to extract integers N and M, and a list of integers L representing the widths of the words. Implement a binary search algorithm to determine the minimum width W that allows the sentence to fit within M lines. For a given width W, implement a helper function 'can_fit_in_lines(W: int, M: int, L: List[int]) -> bool' to check if the words can fit within M lines. In 'can_fit_in_lines', iterate through the list of word widths L and keep track of the current line width and the number of lines used. If adding a word exceeds the width W, increment the line count and reset the current line width to the width of the new word. Ensure that the line count does not exceed M; if it does, return False from 'can_fit_in_lines'. In the main function, set the binary search bounds for W from the maximum word width to the sum of all word widths plus (N-1) for spaces. Perform the binary search to find the smallest W for which 'can_fit_in_lines' returns True. Return the minimum width W as the output of the function.
