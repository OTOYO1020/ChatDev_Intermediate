# Word Fit Application

The Word Fit application is designed to calculate the minimum possible width of a window that allows a given set of words to fit within a specified number of lines. This application utilizes a binary search algorithm to efficiently determine the optimal width for fitting the words.

## Main Functions

- **min_window_width(N: int, M: int, L: List[int]) -> int**: This function calculates the minimum width required to fit the words within the specified number of lines.
  
- **can_fit_in_lines(W: int, M: int, L: List[int]) -> bool**: This helper function checks if the words can fit within the given width `W` and the maximum number of lines `M`.

## Installation

To run the Word Fit application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (if you want to prepare for potential future development):
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**:
   You will be prompted to enter the following:
   - **Number of Words (N)**: The total number of words you want to fit.
   - **Number of Lines (M)**: The maximum number of lines allowed for fitting the words.
   - **Widths of Words**: A comma-separated list of integers representing the widths of each word.

   Example input:
   ```
   Number of Words (N): 5
   Number of Lines (M): 3
   Widths of Words (comma-separated): 3,2,2,5,4
   ```

3. **Output**:
   After providing the inputs, the application will calculate and display the minimum width required to fit the words within the specified number of lines.

   Example output:
   ```
   Minimum Width: 8
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure that:
- Both `N` and `M` are positive integers.
- The list of widths `L` is not empty and contains non-negative integers.
- The number of widths provided matches `N`.

If any of these conditions are not met, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Word Fit application is a powerful tool for determining the optimal width for fitting words into a specified number of lines. By following the instructions above, you can easily install and use the application to meet your needs.
