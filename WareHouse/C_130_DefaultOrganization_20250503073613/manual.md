# Rectangle Area Calculator

A simple application to calculate the areas of sections formed by cutting a rectangle through a specified point.

## Overview

The Rectangle Area Calculator allows users to input the dimensions of a rectangle and a point within it. The application then calculates the areas of the four sections formed by cutting the rectangle through that point. It displays the maximum area of the smaller part and indicates whether there are multiple ways to achieve that area.

## Main Functions

- **Input Dimensions**: Users can input the width (W) and height (H) of the rectangle.
- **Input Coordinates**: Users can input the coordinates (x, y) of a point within or on the border of the rectangle.
- **Area Calculation**: The application calculates the areas of the four sections formed by the cut:
  - Area1: from (0, 0) to (x, y)
  - Area2: from (x, 0) to (W, y)
  - Area3: from (x, y) to (W, H)
  - Area4: from (0, y) to (x, H)
- **Output**: Displays the maximum area of the smaller part and whether there are multiple ways to achieve that area.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Rectangle Area Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Create a `requirements.txt` file if you plan to add dependencies in the future. For now, the application does not require any external libraries, so you can skip this step.

   If you decide to add dependencies later, you can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the application files are located and run the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Width and Height**: The application will prompt you to enter the width (W) and height (H) of the rectangle. Ensure that both values are positive integers.

3. **Input Coordinates**: You will then be prompted to enter the x and y coordinates of the point. The x coordinate must be between 0 and W (inclusive), and the y coordinate must be between 0 and H (inclusive).

4. **View Results**: After entering the coordinates, the application will calculate the areas of the four sections and display:
   - The maximum area of the smaller part.
   - Whether there are multiple ways to achieve that maximum area (Yes/No).

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter Width (W) [positive integer]: 10
Enter Height (H) [positive integer]: 5
Valid range for X: 0 to 10 (inclusive)
Enter X Coordinate: 3
Valid range for Y: 0 to 5 (inclusive)
Enter Y Coordinate: 2
Max Area of Smaller Part: 6
Multiple Ways: No
```
