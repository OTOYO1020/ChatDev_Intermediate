Read the integers W and H from standard input, representing the width and height of the rectangle. Read the integers x and y from standard input, representing the coordinates of the point within or on the border of the rectangle. Calculate the total area of the rectangle as 'total_area = W * H'. Determine the maximum possible area of one part when cutting the rectangle through point (x, y):\n   - Calculate the areas of the four potential sections formed by the cut:\n     - Area1: from (0, 0) to (x, y)\n     - Area2: from (x, 0) to (W, y)\n     - Area3: from (x, y) to (W, H)\n     - Area4: from (0, y) to (x, H) Identify the maximum area of the smaller part, which can be computed as 'max_part_area = min(Area1, Area2, Area3, Area4)'. Check if there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum area:\n   - Compare the areas of the sections to see if any two areas are equal to 'max_part_area'. Store the result indicating if multiple cuts yield the same maximum area. Print the maximum possible area of the smaller part. Print whether there are multiple ways to achieve that maximum area (Yes/No).
