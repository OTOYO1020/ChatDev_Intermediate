# Cost Calculation Dashboard

A user-friendly application designed to calculate the minimum cost required to ensure that all cards are hit based on given constraints.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Reception**: Users can input integers N (number of cards) and M (number of constraints) along with the constraints themselves in the form of (X, Y, Z).
2. **Constraint Management**: Users can dynamically add constraints and validate their inputs.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The application calculates the minimum cost based on the constraints provided and displays the result.
4. **Output Display**: The calculated minimum cost is displayed in a user-friendly manner.

## Installation

To run the Cost Calculation Dashboard, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

   Note: `tkinter` is usually included with Python installations, but if you encounter any issues, ensure it is installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `main.py` file to start the dashboard.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input N and M**:
   - Enter the number of cards (N) in the first input field.
   - Enter the number of constraints (M) in the second input field.

3. **Add Constraints**:
   - Click on the "Add Constraint" button to create input fields for the constraints.
   - For each constraint, enter values for X, Y, and Z:
     - X and Y should be integers representing the indices of the cards (0 to N-1).
     - Z should be either 0 or 1, indicating the parity condition.
   - Click "Save Constraint" to store the constraint. You can add multiple constraints as needed.

4. **Run the Algorithm**:
   - Once you have added all the constraints (up to M), click the "Run Algorithm" button.
   - The application will process the constraints and calculate the minimum cost.

5. **View Results**:
   - The calculated minimum cost will be displayed in the output section of the dashboard.

6. **Reset Constraints**:
   - If you want to start over, you can reset the constraints by clicking the "Reset" button (if implemented).

## Conclusion

The Cost Calculation Dashboard provides a straightforward interface for calculating the minimum cost based on user-defined constraints. By following the steps outlined above, users can easily input their data and obtain results efficiently.
