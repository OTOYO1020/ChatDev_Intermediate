# Takahashi vs Aoki Game

A fun game application where two players, Takahashi and Aoki, compete based on their chosen numbers. The winner is determined by the sums of their choices and whether those sums are prime numbers.

## Main Functions

- **determine_winner(A: int, B: int, C: int, D: int) -> str**: This function encapsulates the game logic. It takes four integers as input, representing the ranges of choices for both players, and returns the winner as a string ('Aoki' or 'Takahashi') based on the game rules.

- **is_prime(n: int) -> bool**: A helper function that checks if a given integer is a prime number.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi vs Aoki game application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You may need to install additional dependencies. You can do this using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can simply run the application without additional dependencies as it uses standard libraries.

## How to Use/Play the Game

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the game files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application directly from the command line.

   - To input values directly:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

   - To read input values from a file:
     Create a text file (e.g., `input.txt`) with the following format:
     ```
     A B C D
     ```
     Then run:
     ```bash
     python main.py input.txt
     ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter four integers A, B, C, and D, separated by spaces. Ensure that they meet the following constraints:
   - \(1 \leq A \leq B \leq 100\)
   - \(1 \leq C \leq D \leq 100\)

4. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will calculate the winner based on the game logic and display the result in the terminal.

## Example Usage

- **Direct Input**:
  ```
  Enter A, B, C, D (space-separated): 1 10 1 10
  The winner is: Takahashi
  ```

- **File Input**:
  Create a file named `input.txt` with the content:
  ```
  1 10 1 10
  ```
  Then run:
  ```bash
  python main.py input.txt
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  The winner is: Takahashi
  ```
