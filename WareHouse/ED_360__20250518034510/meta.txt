Task:
Define the function 'expected_position(N: int, K: int) -> int' to calculate the expected position of the black ball after K operations. Implement input handling to read integers N and K from standard input. Initialize a variable to store the expected position of the black ball, starting at position 1 (the leftmost position). Simulate K operations where for each operation, randomly select two distinct integers a and b between 1 and N. For each selected pair (a, b), swap the positions of the balls at indices a and b. After K operations, calculate the expected position of the black ball based on the number of times it has been at each position. Reduce the expected position to an irreducible fraction P/Q. Compute R such that R * Q ≡ P (mod 998244353) using modular arithmetic. Ensure that the output is within the range 0 ≤ R < 998244353. Print the result R as the final output.
