Read the integer N from standard input. Initialize a counter variable 'count' to 0 to keep track of valid integers. Loop through each integer 'i' from 1 to N (inclusive). For each integer 'i', convert 'i' to its decimal string representation and check if it contains the digit '7':\n   - If it contains '7', skip to the next integer. Convert 'i' to its octal string representation and check if it contains the digit '7':\n   - If it contains '7', skip to the next integer. If 'i' passes both checks (does not contain '7' in both decimal and octal), increment the 'count' by 1. After the loop, print the final value of 'count'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately count the integers that do not contain the digit '7' in both representations within the specified range.
