# Count Valid Integers

A simple application to count integers that do not contain the digit '7' in both decimal and octal representations.

## Quick Install

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the application without any additional dependencies. Just ensure you have a working Python environment.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This application allows users to input a positive integer \( N \) and counts how many integers from 1 to \( N \) do not contain the digit '7' in either their decimal or octal representations. 

### Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
- **Counting Logic**: The application checks each integer from 1 to \( N \) and counts those that do not contain '7' in both decimal and octal forms.
- **Output**: The final count of valid integers is printed to the console.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: 
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input a Positive Integer**:
   - When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \) (e.g., 50).
   - The application will validate the input and ensure it is a positive integer.

3. **View the Result**:
   - After processing, the application will display the count of valid integers that do not contain the digit '7'.

### Example

```
Please enter a positive integer (N) to count valid integers: 50
Count of valid integers: 43
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-integer value or a negative integer, the application will display an error message:
```
Input Error: N must be a positive integer.
```

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: The main application file that handles user input and output.
- **count_logic.py**: A module that contains the logic for counting valid integers.

## Conclusion

This application is a straightforward tool for counting integers based on specific criteria. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for anyone interested in number properties.
