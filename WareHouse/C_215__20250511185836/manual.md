## ü§î What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a board game traditionally played with black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to get five of their stones in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The Gomoku game consists of two main modes:

1. **Console Version**: Play the game in a terminal/command prompt.
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Play the game using a simple graphical interface.

### Console Version
