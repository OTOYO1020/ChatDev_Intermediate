Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of cities. Initialize an adjacency list 'roads' to represent the bidirectional connections between cities. For each of the N-1 roads, read the pairs (A_i, B_i) and populate the 'roads' adjacency list. Initialize a list 'visited' to keep track of visited cities and a stack 'stack' to manage the journey. Start the journey from City 1 by adding it to 'stack' and marking it as visited. Implement a loop to simulate Takahashi's journey:\n   - While there are cities in 'stack', check the current city.\n   - If there are unvisited cities connected to the current city, visit the smallest numbered unvisited city and mark it as visited.\n   - If there are no unvisited cities:\n     - If currently in City 1, break the loop (end the journey).\n     - Otherwise, backtrack to the previous city (the last city in 'stack'). Store the sequence of visited cities in a list 'visited_sequence'. Print the 'visited_sequence' in the order of visitation.
