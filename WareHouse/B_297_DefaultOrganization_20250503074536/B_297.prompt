Receive the string 'S' of length 8 from standard input. Validate that 'S' contains exactly one 'K', one 'Q', and exactly two 'R's, 'B's, and 'N's. Identify the positions of 'B' characters in 'S' and check their parity:\n   - If both 'B' characters have the same parity, return 'INVALID'. Identify the positions of 'R' characters in 'S' and check the position of 'K':\n   - Ensure that 'K' is positioned between the two 'R's; if not, return 'INVALID'. If all conditions are satisfied, return 'VALID'. Print the result based on the checks performed.
