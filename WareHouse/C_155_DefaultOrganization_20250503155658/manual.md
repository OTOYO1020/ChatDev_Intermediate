# Vote Counter Application

A simple application to count votes and determine the most voted strings.

## Overview

The Vote Counter application allows users to input a number of votes represented as strings. It keeps track of the frequency of each string and outputs the strings that received the maximum votes in lexicographical order.

## Main Functions

- **Input Voting Papers**: Users can enter the number of voting papers (N) and then input N strings as votes.
- **Vote Counting**: The application counts the frequency of each string.
- **Determine Most Voted Strings**: After all votes are cast, it identifies the strings with the highest frequency and sorts them in lexicographical order.
- **Output**: The application prints each of the most voted strings on a new line.

## Installation

To run the Vote Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Number of Voting Papers**: When prompted, enter a positive integer (N) representing the number of votes you want to cast.
   ```
   Enter the number of voting papers (positive integer): 
   ```

4. **Cast Your Votes**: For each vote, input a non-empty string when prompted.
   ```
   Enter your vote (string, cannot be empty or whitespace): 
   ```

5. **View Results**: After all votes are entered, the application will display the most voted strings in lexicographical order.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of voting papers (positive integer): 5
Enter your vote (string, cannot be empty or whitespace): apple
Enter your vote (string, cannot be empty or whitespace): banana
Enter your vote (string, cannot be empty or whitespace): apple
Enter your vote (string, cannot be empty or whitespace): orange
Enter your vote (string, cannot be empty or whitespace): banana

Most voted strings:
apple
banana
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the input for votes is not empty or just whitespace; otherwise, the application will prompt you to enter a valid vote.
- If no votes are cast, the application will notify you that no votes have been recorded.
