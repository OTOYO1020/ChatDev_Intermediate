Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of voting papers. Initialize a dictionary 'vote_count' to keep track of the frequency of each string S_i. Loop from 1 to N to read each string S_i from standard input:\n   - For each string, update its count in the 'vote_count' dictionary. Determine the maximum frequency of votes by finding the maximum value in 'vote_count'. Create a list 'most_voted_strings' to store all strings that have the maximum frequency. Loop through 'vote_count' to populate 'most_voted_strings' with strings that match the maximum frequency. Sort 'most_voted_strings' in lexicographical order. Print each string in 'most_voted_strings' on a new line.\n\nOutput format:\n- Each string from 'most_voted_strings' should be printed in lexicographical order, one per line.
