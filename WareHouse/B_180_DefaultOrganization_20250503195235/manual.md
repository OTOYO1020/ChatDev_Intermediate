# Distance Calculator

A simple web application for calculating Manhattan, Euclidean, and Chebyshev distances in N-dimensional space.

## Introduction

The Distance Calculator allows users to input coordinates in an N-dimensional space and computes three types of distances:
- **Manhattan Distance**: The sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates.
- **Euclidean Distance**: The straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
- **Chebyshev Distance**: The maximum absolute difference among the coordinates.

## Quick Install

To run the Distance Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

You may need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install math
```

## How to Use the Distance Calculator

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
   - Run the application using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - First, input an integer `N`, which represents the number of dimensions.
   - On the next line, input `N` integers separated by spaces or commas, which represent the coordinates in the N-dimensional space.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   3
   1, -2, 3
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - The application will output three lines:
     - The first line will display the Manhattan distance.
     - The second line will display the Euclidean distance, formatted to two decimal places.
     - The third line will display the Chebyshev distance.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   6
   3.74
   3
   ```

## Error Handling

If the input does not match the expected format, the application will raise an error message indicating the issue. Ensure that:
- The first input is an integer.
- The second input contains exactly `N` integers.

## Conclusion

The Distance Calculator is a straightforward tool for computing distances in multi-dimensional space. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear output for the distances calculated. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our support team.
