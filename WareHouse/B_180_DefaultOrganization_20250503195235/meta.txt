Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of dimensions. Read the N integers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N \) from standard input, which represent the coordinates in the N-dimensional space. Initialize variables 'manhattan_distance', 'euclidean_distance', and 'chebyshev_distance' to 0. Loop through each coordinate \( x_i \) (from 1 to N):\n   - Update 'manhattan_distance' by adding the absolute value of \( x_i \) to it.\n   - Update 'euclidean_distance' by adding the square of the absolute value of \( x_i \) to it.\n   - Update 'chebyshev_distance' by comparing the absolute value of \( x_i \) with the current maximum value. After the loop, compute the square root of 'euclidean_distance' to get the final Euclidean distance. Print the results for 'manhattan_distance', 'euclidean_distance', and 'chebyshev_distance' in the specified format. \n\nOutput format:\n- The output should consist of three lines, each containing one of the distances: Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, and Chebyshev distance.
