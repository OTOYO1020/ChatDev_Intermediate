# Card Management Application

A Python application designed to manage card values through a series of operations, maximizing the total value of the cards.

## Main Functions

The Card Management Application provides the following key functionalities:

1. **Input Initialization**: 
   - Reads the number of cards (N), number of operations (M), and the initial values on each card (A).
   - Accepts a series of operations defined by pairs (B_j, C_j), where B_j is the number of cards to replace and C_j is the new value.

2. **Card Management**:
   - Efficiently manages the card values using a min-heap to allow quick access to the smallest card values.

3. **Operation Optimization**:
   - Sorts operations in descending order based on the new value (C_j) to maximize the total value after applying the operations.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Computes and outputs the maximum sum of the card values after applying the specified operations.

## Installation

To run the Card Management Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: 
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Install the necessary dependencies using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install heapq
     ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the application files are located.
   - Execute the main script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input the Data**:
   - You will be prompted to enter the following:
     - **Number of Cards (N)**: Enter a positive integer representing the total number of cards.
     - **Number of Operations (M)**: Enter a positive integer representing the total number of operations you want to perform.
     - **Initial Card Values (A)**: Enter N integers separated by spaces, representing the initial values on each card.
     - **Operations (B_j, C_j)**: For each operation, enter two integers separated by a space. B_j should be a positive integer not exceeding N, and C_j is the new value to replace the smallest cards.

3. **View the Result**:
   - After entering all the required data, the application will process the operations and display the maximum sum of the card values after the operations have been applied.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```
Number of Cards (N): 5
Number of Operations (M): 3
Initial Card Values (A): 1 2 3 4 5
Operations (B_j, C_j): 2 10
Operations (B_j, C_j): 1 8
Operations (B_j, C_j): 3 6
```

**Output**:
```
Maximum Sum: 30
```

## Conclusion

The Card Management Application is a powerful tool for efficiently managing and optimizing card values through a series of operations. By following the steps outlined in this manual, users can easily set up and utilize the application to achieve the maximum possible sum of card values.
