Task:
Define the function 'count_black_squares(N: int, P: List[List[str]], queries: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to retrieve the integer N and the 2D list P representing the grid colors. Implement a function to process each query, extracting the integers A, B, C, and D from the queries list. Calculate the number of black squares in the specified rectangular area using the formula 'P[i % N][j % N]'. Use a nested loop to iterate through the range from A to C and B to D to count the black squares. Store the results of each query in a list to be returned after processing all queries. Ensure that the function efficiently handles up to 200,000 queries without exceeding time limits. Implement input validation to ensure that N, Q, A, B, C, and D are within the specified constraints. Return the list of counts of black squares for each query as the output of the function. Format the output as a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the result of a query.
