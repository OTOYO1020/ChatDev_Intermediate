# Black Square Counting Application

A Python application designed to efficiently count the number of black squares in a grid based on user-defined queries.

## Main Functions

The application provides the following main functionalities:

- **Count Black Squares**: Given a grid of colors and a series of queries, the application calculates the number of black squares ('B') in specified rectangular areas of the grid.
- **Input Handling**: The application accepts user input for the grid size, grid colors, and queries.
- **Efficient Query Processing**: The application is optimized to handle up to 200,000 queries without exceeding time limits.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the application is hosted on a version control system like Git, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install any required dependencies. For this application, you may not need additional libraries, but ensure you have `typing` available (it is included in Python 3.5 and later):
   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Grid Size**: When prompted, enter the size of the grid (N):
   ```
   Enter N (size of grid): 3
   ```

3. **Input the Grid Colors**: Enter each row of the grid, separating colors with spaces. Use 'B' for black squares and any other character for non-black squares:
   ```
   Enter row 1 of the grid: B W B
   Enter row 2 of the grid: W B W
   Enter row 3 of the grid: B W B
   ```

4. **Input the Number of Queries**: Specify how many queries you want to perform:
   ```
   Enter number of queries: 2
   ```

5. **Input the Queries**: For each query, enter the coordinates A, B, C, and D, which define the rectangular area to check for black squares:
   ```
   Enter query (A B C D): 0 0 2 2
   Enter query (A B C D): 1 1 3 3
   ```

6. **View Results**: After entering all queries, the application will output the results:
   ```
   Results: [5, 4]
   ```

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how the input and output would look:

```
Enter N (size of grid): 3
Enter row 1 of the grid: B W B
Enter row 2 of the grid: W B W
Enter row 3 of the grid: B W B
Enter number of queries: 2
Enter query (A B C D): 0 0 2 2
Enter query (A B C D): 1 1 3 3
Results: [5, 4]
```

## Conclusion

This application is designed to provide a quick and efficient way to count black squares in a grid based on user-defined queries. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
