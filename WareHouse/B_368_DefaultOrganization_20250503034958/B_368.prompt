Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of positive integers in the sequence. Read the sequence of integers A from standard input, ensuring it contains N positive integers. Initialize a counter variable 'operation_count' to 0 to keep track of the number of operations performed. While the number of positive elements in A is greater than 1:\n   - Sort the array A in descending order.\n   - Decrease both 'A[0]' and 'A[1]' by 1 (the first two elements after sorting).\n   - Increment 'operation_count' by 1. Print the value of 'operation_count' as the final output.
