# Sequence Processing Application

A Python application for processing sequences based on user-defined operations.

## Overview

This application allows users to input sequences of integers and apply a series of operations based on specified conditions. The operations include addition, maximum, and minimum calculations, providing a flexible way to manipulate integer sequences.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application reads integers and sequences from standard input.
2. **Function Processing**: The core function `f(x, a_i, t_i)` performs operations based on the value of `t_i`:
   - If `t_i = 1`, it returns `x + a_i`.
   - If `t_i = 2`, it returns `max(x, a_i)`.
   - If `t_i = 3`, it returns `min(x, a_i)`.
3. **Result Calculation**: For each integer in sequence `X`, the application processes the sequences `A` and `T` to compute the final results.
4. **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling for invalid inputs and operations.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python installed correctly.

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Application Directory**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Data**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - Two integers `N` (length of sequences A and T) and `Q` (length of sequence X) separated by space.
   - A sequence `A` of length `N` (space-separated integers).
   - A sequence `T` of length `N` (space-separated integers, must be 1, 2, or 3).
   - A sequence `X` of length `Q` (space-separated integers).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter two integers N (length of sequences A and T) and Q (length of sequence X) separated by space: 3 2
   Enter 3 integers for sequence A (space-separated): 5 10 3
   Enter 3 integers for sequence T (space-separated): 1 2 3
   Enter 2 integers for sequence X (space-separated): 4 8
   ```

4. **View Results**: After processing, the application will print the results for all `x_i` in sequence.

## Error Handling

The application includes error messages for the following scenarios:
- Invalid input format (non-integer values).
- Mismatched lengths of sequences.
- Invalid values in sequence `T` (must be 1, 2, or 3).

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to process integer sequences with defined operations. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
