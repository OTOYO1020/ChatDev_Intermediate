Task:
Read integers N and Q from standard input. Read the sequence A of length N from standard input. Read the sequence T of length N from standard input. Read the sequence X of length Q from standard input. Initialize a function 'f(x, a_i, t_i)' that takes an integer x, an integer a_i, and an integer t_i to compute the result based on the defined conditions:\n   - If t_i = 1, return 'x + a_i'.\n   - If t_i = 2, return 'max(x, a_i)'.\n   - If t_i = 3, return 'min(x, a_i)'. For each x_i in X, initialize a variable 'result = x_i'. Loop through the indices from 1 to N:\n   - Update 'result' by calling 'f(result, A[i-1], T[i-1])'. Store the final result for each x_i after processing all functions. Print the results for all x_i in sequence.
