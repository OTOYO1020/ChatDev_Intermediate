Task:
Read the integer N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'modulo = 998244353' to store the modulo value. Create a 2D array 'dp' of size (N+1) x 10 to store the count of valid integers ending with each digit from 0 to 9. Set the base case: For 'i = 1', initialize 'dp[1][1]' to 1, 'dp[1][2]' to 1, ..., 'dp[1][9]' to 1 (since the first digit cannot be 0). Loop from 'i = 2' to 'N' to fill the 'dp' array:\n   - For each digit 'j' from 1 to 9:\n     - Update 'dp[i][j]' as the sum of 'dp[i-1][j-1]', 'dp[i-1][j]', and 'dp[i-1][j+1]' (considering bounds). Calculate the total valid integers of length N by summing 'dp[N][1]' to 'dp[N][9]'. Take the result modulo '998244353'. Print the final count of valid integers.
