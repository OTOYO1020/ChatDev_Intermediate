# Integer Counting Application

A simple application to count valid integers of a specified length based on specific rules using dynamic programming.

## Overview

This application allows users to input an integer \( N \) and calculates the count of valid integers of length \( N \) that can end with digits from 0 to 9, adhering to the rules defined in the task. The application is built using Python and utilizes a dynamic programming approach for efficient computation.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter a positive integer \( N \).
- **Dynamic Programming Logic**: It uses a 2D array to store counts of valid integers based on their last digit.
- **Output**: The application outputs the total count of valid integers of length \( N \) modulo \( 998244353 \).

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. If you need to manage dependencies in a virtual environment, you can use:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Length of Integers**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \) (e.g., `5`).

3. **View Results**: After entering the input, the application will calculate and display the count of valid integers of length \( N \).

### Example

```plaintext
Enter the length of integers (N): 5
Count of valid integers of length 5: 1000
```

## Error Handling

- If the input is not a positive integer, the application will prompt the user to enter a valid input until a correct value is provided.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to count valid integers based on specified rules. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, leveraging dynamic programming for optimal performance.
