# Dragon Arrangement

A software application for arranging dragon parts on a grid, starting from the center position where Takahashi is placed.

## Quick Install

To run the Dragon Arrangement software, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## 🤔 What is this?

The Dragon Arrangement software allows users to visualize the placement of dragon parts on an N x N grid. The grid is initialized with Takahashi placed at the center, and dragon parts are arranged around him in a spiral pattern. This application is useful for anyone interested in grid-based arrangements and visualizations.

## 🛠️ Main Functions

### `arrange_dragon_parts(N: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`

- **Description**: This function handles the arrangement of dragon parts on an N x N grid.
- **Parameters**:
  - `N` (int): The size of the grid (must be a positive integer).
- **Returns**: A list of tuples representing the positions where dragon parts are placed, excluding Takahashi's position.

### `main()`

- **Description**: The main entry point of the application that prompts the user for grid size and displays the arranged grid.
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the grid size (N).
- **Output**: Displays the grid with Takahashi and dragon parts.

### `display_grid(N, positions)`

- **Description**: Displays the grid with Takahashi and dragon parts.
- **Parameters**:
  - `N` (int): The size of the grid.
  - `positions` (List[Tuple[int, int]]): The positions of the dragon parts.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Grid Size**:
   - When prompted, enter a positive integer for the grid size (N). For example, entering `5` will create a 5x5 grid.

3. **View the Arrangement**:
   - After entering the grid size, the application will display the grid with 'T' representing Takahashi and 'D' representing dragon parts.

### Example Output

For an input of `5`, the output may look like this:

```
  D D D D D
  D       D
  D   T   D
  D       D
  D D D D D
```

## 📚 Additional Information

- Ensure that the grid size (N) is at least 1; otherwise, the application will prompt an error message.
- The arrangement of dragon parts follows a spiral pattern around Takahashi.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

We plan to enhance the software by adding features such as:
- Customizable symbols for Takahashi and dragon parts.
- Different arrangement patterns.
- Exporting the grid arrangement to various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
