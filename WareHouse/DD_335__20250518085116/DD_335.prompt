Define the function 'arrange_dragon_parts(N: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]' to handle the grid arrangement, where N is the size of the grid. Initialize a 2D list 'grid' of size N x N to represent the grid. Calculate the center position of the grid as 'center = (N // 2, N // 2)' and place Takahashi at this position. Create a variable 'current_position' initialized to 'center' to track the position of the last placed dragon part. Iterate from 'x = 2' to 'N^2 - 1' to place each dragon part in the grid. For each 'x', determine the next position to place the dragon part by checking the adjacent cells of 'current_position'. Ensure that the next position is valid (within bounds and not already occupied) before placing the dragon part 'x'. Update 'current_position' to the newly placed position after placing each dragon part. Return the list of positions where the dragon parts are placed, excluding the position of Takahashi. Print the output in the required format, showing the arrangement of dragon parts in the grid.
