# Enemy Defeat Application

A simple application to calculate the time taken to defeat a group of enemies based on their health values.

## Main Functions

The Enemy Defeat application provides the following main functionalities:

- **Calculate Time to Defeat Enemies**: The core function `calculate_time_to_defeat_enemies(N: int, H: List[int]) -> int` takes the number of enemies and their respective health values as input and calculates the time required to defeat all enemies based on specific rules.

## Installation

To run the Enemy Defeat application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: The application requires no additional dependencies beyond the standard library. You can run the application directly without any extra installations.

## Usage

To use the Enemy Defeat application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files (`main.py` and `enemy_defeat.py`) are located.

2. **Execute the Main File**: Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: The application will prompt you to enter the number of enemies and their health values:
   - Enter the number of enemies (an integer).
   - Enter the health values as a comma-separated list (e.g., `10,5,3`).

4. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will calculate and display the time taken to defeat all enemies.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter number of enemies: 3
Enter health values (comma-separated): 10,5,3
Time to defeat enemies: 15
```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling. If the number of health values does not match the number of enemies, or if there is an invalid input, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Enemy Defeat application is a straightforward tool for calculating the time to defeat enemies based on their health. Feel free to modify the code for additional features or improvements!
