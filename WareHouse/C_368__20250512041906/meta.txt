Task:
Define a function 'calculate_time_to_defeat_enemies(N: int, H: List[int]) -> int' that takes the number of enemies 'N' and a list of their healths 'H' as input. Initialize a variable 'T' to '0' to keep track of the time taken to defeat the enemies. Create a loop that continues until all health values in 'H' are '0' or less. Inside the loop, increment 'T' by '1'. Check if 'T' is a multiple of '3'. If it is, decrease the health of the frontmost enemy (first element of 'H') by '3' if its health is '1' or more; otherwise, decrease it by '1'. If the frontmost enemy's health drops to '0' or less, remove that enemy from the list 'H'. Ensure that the loop correctly handles the case where there are no enemies left to attack. Return the value of 'T' once all enemies have health '0' or less. Handle input reading and parsing to extract 'N' and 'H' from the input format. Output the final value of 'T' as an integer.
