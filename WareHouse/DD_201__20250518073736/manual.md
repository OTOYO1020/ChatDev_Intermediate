# Game Application

Welcome to the Game Application! This software allows you to play a strategic game between two players, Takahashi and Aoki, on a grid filled with blue and red squares. The objective is to maximize your score while navigating from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

## Main Functions

- **Game Logic**: The game alternates between two players, Takahashi and Aoki, who move through a grid of squares. Players earn points by landing on blue squares and lose points by landing on red squares.
- **Score Calculation**: The game keeps track of each player's score and determines the winner based on the final scores.
- **Input Handling**: The application reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself from standard input.

## Installation

To run the Game Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Input the Grid**:

     B R B
     R B R
     B B R
     ```

4. **Game Play**:
