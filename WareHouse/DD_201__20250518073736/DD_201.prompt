Define the function 'game_result(H: int, W: int, A: List[List[str]]) -> str' to handle the input parameters where H is the number of rows, W is the number of columns, and A is the grid representing the squares. Implement input handling to read the values of H and W, and the grid A from standard input. Initialize two variables 'takahashi_points' and 'aoki_points' to zero to keep track of the scores for both players. Create a loop to simulate the game where Takahashi and Aoki alternately move the piece from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. In each iteration of the loop, determine the current player's move (either right or down) based on maximizing their score. Update the current player's score based on the color of the square they land on (increment for blue, decrement for red). Check if the current player can make a valid move; if not, end the game and determine the winner based on the scores. Implement logic to compare the scores of Takahashi and Aoki to decide the outcome: 'Takahashi', 'Aoki', or 'Draw'. Return the result of the game as a string from the function 'game_result'. Ensure the output format is correct, returning 'Takahashi', 'Aoki', or 'Draw' based on the final scores.
