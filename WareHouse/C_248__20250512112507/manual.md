# Sequence Counter

A Python application for counting valid integer sequences based on user-defined parameters.

## Overview

The Sequence Counter application allows users to define a function that counts the number of valid sequences of a specified length, with values constrained within a defined range. The application checks if the sum of the sequence elements is less than or equal to a specified maximum value.

## Main Functions

- **count_sequences(N: int, M: int, K: int) -> int**: This function encapsulates the logic for counting valid sequences. It generates all possible integer sequences of length `N` with values between `1` and `M`, checks if their sum is less than or equal to `K`, and returns the count of such valid sequences modulo `998244353`.

## Installation

To run the Sequence Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application uses the `itertools` module, which is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**: When prompted, enter three integers `N`, `M`, and `K`, separated by spaces. Ensure that the values satisfy the following constraints:
   - `1 ≤ N, M ≤ 50`
   - `N ≤ K ≤ N * M`

   Example input:
   ```
   3 5 10
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the input, the application will calculate and display the count of valid sequences that meet the criteria.

   Example output:
   ```
   Valid Sequences Count: 10
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for invalid inputs. If the input values do not satisfy the constraints, an error message will be displayed:

```
Input Error: Input values must satisfy: 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 50 and N ≤ K ≤ NM.
```

In case of unexpected errors, a general error message will be shown:

```
Unexpected Error: <error message>
```

## Conclusion

The Sequence Counter application is a powerful tool for counting valid integer sequences based on user-defined parameters. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily set up and run the application to obtain the desired results.
