# Smallest Integer Finder

A Python application to find the smallest integer \( X \) that can be expressed in the form \( X = a^3 + a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \).

## Quick Install

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: As of now, there are no additional dependencies specified, but ensure you have Python 3.x installed.*

## 🤔 What is this?

This application reads a non-negative integer \( N \) from the user and finds the smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the given polynomial expression. The application uses nested loops to check for valid pairs of non-negative integers \( (a, b) \) and prints the result.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Run the Application:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Non-Negative Integer:**
   When prompted, enter a non-negative integer \( N \). The application will validate your input.

3. **View the Result:**
   After processing, the application will output the smallest integer \( X \) that meets the specified conditions.

## 🛠️ Main Functions

### `find_smallest_x(n)`

- **Description:** Finds the smallest integer \( X \) starting from \( N \) that can be expressed as \( X = a^3 + a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 \).
- **Parameters:** 
  - `n` (int): The starting integer to check from.
- **Returns:** The smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the conditions.

### `can_express_as_polynomial(remaining, a)`

- **Description:** Checks if the remaining value can be expressed as \( a^2b + ab^2 \) for any non-negative integer \( b \).
- **Parameters:**
  - `remaining` (int): The value to check against.
  - `a` (int): The current value of \( a \).
- **Returns:** `True` if a valid \( b \) exists, otherwise `False`.

### `validate_input(input_value)`

- **Description:** Validates if the input is a valid non-negative integer.
- **Parameters:**
  - `input_value` (str): The input value to validate.
- **Returns:** `True` if valid, otherwise `False`.

### `main()`

- **Description:** The main function that runs the application, handles user input, and displays the result.
