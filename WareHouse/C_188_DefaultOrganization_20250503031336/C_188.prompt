Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of players as \(2^N\). Read the ratings of players into an array \(A\) of size \(2^N\). Create a list of player labels from 1 to \(2^N\). Initialize a list \(winners\) to keep track of players who have not lost. For each round \(i\) from 1 to \(N\):\n   - For each match \(j\) from 1 to \(2^{N-i}\):\n     - Identify the players participating in the match using their labels: \(player1 = winners[2j-2]\) and \(player2 = winners[2j-1]\).\n     - Determine the winner based on the ratings in \(A\) and update the \(winners\) list accordingly. After all rounds, the last two players in the \(winners\) list will be the finalists. Identify the player who loses in the final match (the second place). Print the label of the player who takes second place.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to implement: 'find_second_place(N, A)'\n- Variables: 'winners', 'player1', 'player2', 'finalists'
