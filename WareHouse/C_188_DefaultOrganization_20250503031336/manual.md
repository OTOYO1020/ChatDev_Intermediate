# Tournament System

A simple application to determine the second place player in a tournament based on player ratings.

## Main Functions

The Tournament System allows users to:
- Input the number of players in the tournament, represented as \(2^N\).
- Input player ratings.
- Determine the second place player based on the ratings provided.

## Quick Install

To run the Tournament System, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository and run the application directly.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install any required dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Players**:
   When prompted, enter the integer \(N\) which represents the number of players as \(2^N\). For example, if you want 4 players, enter `2` (since \(2^2 = 4\)).

3. **Input Player Ratings**:
   Enter the ratings for each player as a comma-separated list. Ensure that the number of ratings matches \(2^N\). For example, for 4 players, you might enter:
   ```
   10, 20, 15, 25
   ```

4. **View the Result**:
   After processing, the application will output the label of the player who takes second place.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter number of players (N): 2
Enter player ratings (comma-separated): 10, 20, 15, 25
The second place player is: 3
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input issues:
- If \(N\) is negative or results in more than 1024 players, an error will be raised.
- If the number of ratings does not match \(2^N\), an error will be raised.
- If there is a tie in ratings, an error will be raised indicating the players involved.

## Conclusion

This Tournament System is a straightforward tool for determining the second place in a competitive setting based on player ratings. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear error messages to guide users in case of incorrect input.
