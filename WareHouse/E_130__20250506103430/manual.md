# Subsequence Counter

A Python application for counting subsequences in two integer sequences and calculating matching subsequence pairs.

## Overview

This software reads two sequences of integers, calculates the number of possible subsequences for each unique integer in both sequences, and determines the total number of matching subsequence pairs. The results are printed as a single integer value.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: Reads integers N and M, followed by two sequences S and T of lengths N and M, respectively.
2. **Frequency Counting**: Utilizes a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the sequences.
3. **Subsequence Calculation**: Computes the number of subsequences for each unique integer using the formula \(2^{\text{count}} - 1\).
4. **Total Pairs Calculation**: Multiplies the number of subsequences from both sequences for matching integers and sums them up, taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
5. **Output**: Prints the total number of matching subsequence pairs.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip.

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the integers N and M followed by the sequences S and T. For example:

   ```
   5 4
   1 2 2 3 3
   2 3 3 4
   ```

   In this example, `N` is 5, `M` is 4, sequence `S` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, and sequence `T` is `[2, 3, 3, 4]`.

4. **View Results**: After entering the input, the application will process the data and print the total number of matching subsequence pairs.

## Example

Here is an example of how to run the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
5 4
1 2 2 3 3
2 3 3 4
```

**Output:**
```
5
```

This output indicates that there are 5 matching subsequence pairs between the two sequences.

## Conclusion

This software provides a straightforward way to analyze integer sequences for subsequences and matching pairs. For any issues or further inquiries, please contact the support team.
