Read integers N and M from standard input, followed by the sequences S and T of lengths N and M, respectively. Initialize a dictionary 'count_S' to store the frequency of each integer in sequence S. Initialize a dictionary 'count_T' to store the frequency of each integer in sequence T. For each unique integer in 'count_S', calculate the number of subsequences that can be formed from S using the formula '2^count_S[x] - 1' for each integer x in S. For each unique integer in 'count_T', calculate the number of subsequences that can be formed from T using the formula '2^count_T[y] - 1' for each integer y in T. Initialize a variable 'total_pairs' to 0 to accumulate the total number of matching subsequence pairs. For each unique integer that appears in both 'count_S' and 'count_T', multiply the number of subsequences from S and T for that integer and add to 'total_pairs'. Take 'total_pairs' modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers. Print the final value of 'total_pairs' as the result.
