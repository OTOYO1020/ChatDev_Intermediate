Task:
Read the dimensions \( H_A, W_A, H_B, W_B, H_X, W_X \) from standard input. Read the \( H_A \) strings representing sheet \( A \) into a list 'A' of size \( H_A \). Read the \( H_B \) strings representing sheet \( B \) into a list 'B' of size \( H_B \). Read the \( H_X \) strings representing sheet \( X \) into a list 'X' of size \( H_X \). Create a function 'create_sheet_C(A, B)' that combines sheets \( A \) and \( B \) into an infinitely large sheet \( C \) by overlaying them. In 'create_sheet_C', iterate through each cell in sheets \( A \) and \( B \) to determine the color of each corresponding cell in sheet \( C \):\n   - If either \( A[i][j] \) or \( B[i][j] \) is '#', set \( C[i][j] \) to '#'; otherwise, set it to '.'. Create a function 'can_cut_out(C, X, H_X, W_X)' that checks if a cut-out area from sheet \( C \) can match sheet \( X \) while including all black squares from sheets \( A \) and \( B \). In 'can_cut_out', iterate through all possible positions where the \( H_X \times W_X \) area can be cut from \( C \) and check if it matches \( X \) and contains all black squares. Ensure that the cut-out area includes all black squares from both sheets \( A \) and \( B \) by maintaining a count of black squares and verifying against the cut-out. Print YES if the cut-out can be achieved, otherwise print NO.
