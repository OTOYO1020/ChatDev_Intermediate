Here is the `manual.md` file that provides a detailed user manual for the software developed to handle the sheet overlay and cut-out checking task:

# Sheet Overlay and Cut-out Checker

This application allows users to overlay two sheets and check if a specified cut-out area can be extracted while ensuring all black squares from the original sheets are included.

## Main Functions

1. **create_sheet_C(A, B)**: 
   - Combines two sheets \( A \) and \( B \) into a new sheet \( C \) by overlaying them. 
   - If either \( A[i][j] \) or \( B[i][j] \) is '#', then \( C[i][j] \) is set to '#'; otherwise, it is set to '.'.

2. **can_cut_out(C, X, H_X, W_X)**:
   - Checks if a cut-out area from sheet \( C \) can match sheet \( X \) while including all black squares from sheets \( A \) and \( B \).
   - Iterates through all possible positions for the cut-out and verifies if it contains all required black squares.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input Format**:
   The application expects input in the following format:
   ```
   H_A W_A H_B W_B H_X W_X
   <H_A strings representing sheet A>
   <H_B strings representing sheet B>
   <H_X strings representing sheet X>
   ```

   - \( H_A, W_A \): Dimensions of sheet A.
   - \( H_B, W_B \): Dimensions of sheet B.
   - \( H_X, W_X \): Dimensions of sheet X.
   - Each string should consist of characters '#' (black) and '.' (white).

2. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application from the command line:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Provide the input as specified above. The application will output "YES" if the cut-out can be achieved, otherwise it will output "NO".

## Example

### Input:
```
3 3 3 3 2 2
.#.
###
...
.#.
###
...
```

### Output:
```
YES
```
