# Interval Intersection Counter

A Python application for counting intersecting interval pairs based on user-defined intervals.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a series of intervals, each defined by a type (closed or open) and a range (left and right bounds). The application will then calculate and output the number of intersecting pairs of these intervals.

## Main Functions

- **count_intersecting_intervals(N: int, intervals: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int**: This function takes the number of intervals and a list of interval tuples, and returns the count of intersecting interval pairs.

- **do_intervals_intersect(interval1: Tuple[int, int], interval2: Tuple[int, int]) -> bool**: A helper function that checks if two intervals intersect based on their definitions (closed or open).

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application requires the following Python libraries:
- `typing` (included in Python standard library)

You can install any additional dependencies using pip if needed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the application files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the intervals in the following format:
   ```
   t1, l1, r1; t2, l2, r2; ...; tN, lN, rN
   ```
   - `t_i` is the type of the interval (1 for closed, 2 for open).
   - `l_i` is the left bound of the interval.
   - `r_i` is the right bound of the interval.
   - Each interval should be separated by a semicolon (`;`).

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   1, 1, 5; 2, 3, 7; 1, 6, 8
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will output the number of intersecting pairs of intervals.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   Number of intersecting pairs: 2
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for input validation. If the input format is incorrect or if the interval definitions are invalid, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to count intersecting intervals based on user-defined input. For further assistance or feature requests, please contact the development team.
