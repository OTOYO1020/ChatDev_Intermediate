Task:
Define a function 'count_intersecting_intervals(N: int, intervals: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int' to count the number of intersecting interval pairs. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a tuple (t_i, l_i, r_i). Implement a method to convert the interval type t_i into a corresponding mathematical representation based on the definitions provided for closed and open intervals. Create a helper function 'do_intervals_intersect(interval1: Tuple[int, int], interval2: Tuple[int, int]) -> bool' to determine if two intervals intersect based on their definitions. Iterate through all pairs of intervals (i, j) with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N and use the helper function to check for intersections. Count the number of intersecting pairs and store the result in a variable 'count'. Ensure that the function handles the constraints correctly, particularly the limits on N and the values of l_i and r_i. Return the final count of intersecting pairs from the 'count_intersecting_intervals' function. Implement input handling to read from standard input and format the data into the required structure for the function. Output the result of the function in the specified format.
