Task:
Define the function 'max_consecutive_Xs(S: str, K: int) -> int' to calculate the maximum possible number of consecutive 'X's in the string 'S' after performing the operations. Implement input handling to read the string 'S' and the integer 'K' from standard input. Validate the input to ensure that the length of 'S' is between 1 and 200,000 and that 'K' is between 0 and 200,000. Initialize a variable 'max_count' to keep track of the maximum number of consecutive 'X's found. Use a sliding window approach to iterate through the string 'S', maintaining a count of '.' characters within the current window. If the count of '.' characters in the current window exceeds 'K', adjust the left end of the window to reduce the count. Update 'max_count' whenever a valid window (with '.' count <= K) is found, calculating the length of the current window. After processing the entire string, return the value of 'max_count' as the result. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when 'S' contains only 'X's or only '.'s. Output the result as an integer representing the maximum number of consecutive 'X's after performing the operations.
