# Max Consecutive Xs

A Python application to calculate the maximum possible number of consecutive 'X's in a string after performing specified operations.

## Overview

The `max_consecutive_Xs` application allows users to determine the maximum number of consecutive 'X's in a given string `S` after converting up to `K` '.' characters into 'X's. This is achieved using a sliding window approach to efficiently count and manage the characters in the string.

## Main Functions

- **max_consecutive_Xs(S: str, K: int) -> int**: This function calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'X's that can be achieved in the string `S` after converting up to `K` '.' characters to 'X's.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: If there are no additional dependencies, you can skip this step.)*

## Usage

To use the `max_consecutive_Xs` application, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects two lines of input:
   - The first line should contain the string `S` (1 ≤ len(S) ≤ 200,000).
   - The second line should contain the integer `K` (0 ≤ K ≤ 200,000).

   Example input:
   ```
   X..XX..X
   2
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application from the command line. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Handling**: The application will read the input from standard input. Ensure that your input adheres to the specified format. The application will validate the input and provide error messages if the input is invalid.

4. **Output**: After processing the input, the application will output the maximum number of consecutive 'X's as an integer.

## Example

Given the input:
```
X..XX..X
2
```

The output will be:
```
5
```

This indicates that by converting up to 2 '.' characters to 'X's, the maximum number of consecutive 'X's is 5.

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation and will provide error messages for the following cases:
- If `S` is empty or does not contain any 'X' or '.' characters.
- If `K` is not provided or is not an integer.
- If the length of `S` is not within the specified range.
- If `K` is not within the specified range.

## Edge Cases

- If `S` consists entirely of '.' characters, the output will be equal to `K`, as all '.' can be converted to 'X'.
- If `S` contains only 'X's, the output will be the length of `S`.

## Conclusion

The `max_consecutive_Xs` application is a powerful tool for analyzing strings and determining the potential for maximizing consecutive characters through specified operations. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our development team.
