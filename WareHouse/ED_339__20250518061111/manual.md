# Max Subsequence Length Calculator

A simple application to calculate the maximum length of a valid subsequence based on specified criteria.

## Overview

The Max Subsequence Length Calculator allows users to input a sequence of integers and determine the maximum length of a subsequence where the absolute difference between adjacent elements does not exceed a specified limit. This tool is useful for various applications in data analysis and algorithm design.

## Main Functions

- **max_subsequence_length(N: int, D: int, A: List[int])**: This function calculates the maximum length of a valid subsequence based on the given criteria.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `N`: The length of the sequence.
    - `D`: The maximum allowed absolute difference between adjacent elements.
    - `A`: A list of integers representing the sequence.
  - **Returns**: An integer representing the maximum length of the valid subsequence.

## Installation

To run the Max Subsequence Length Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: You can install the necessary dependencies using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

   Note: The `typing` module is included in the standard library for Python 3.5 and above, so you may not need to install it separately.

## Usage

To use the Max Subsequence Length Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt. You can do this by navigating to the directory containing the file and running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Data**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - The length of the sequence (N).
   - The maximum allowed absolute difference (D).
   - The sequence of integers separated by commas (e.g., `1,2,3`).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the length of the sequence (N): 5
   Enter the maximum allowed absolute difference (D): 2
   Enter the sequence of integers separated by commas (e.g., 1,2,3 without spaces): 1,3,5,7,9
   ```

3. **View the Result**: After entering the data, the application will calculate and display the maximum length of the valid subsequence.

   Example output:
   ```
   Max Subsequence Length: 5
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs. If the input does not match the expected format or if the length of the sequence does not match the specified N, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Max Subsequence Length Calculator is a straightforward tool for analyzing sequences based on specified criteria. By following the instructions above, users can easily install and utilize the application for their needs. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our development team.
