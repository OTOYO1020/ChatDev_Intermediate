Task:
Define a function 'max_subsequence_length(N: int, D: int, A: List[int])' that takes the length of the sequence, the maximum allowed absolute difference, and the sequence itself as input. Implement input handling to read integers N and D, and a list of integers A from standard input. Initialize a variable 'max_length' to keep track of the maximum length of the valid subsequence. Iterate through the sequence A using a loop to evaluate each element and its adjacent elements. For each element A[i], check if the absolute difference with the previous element in the valid subsequence is at most D. If the condition is satisfied, increment the current length of the valid subsequence. If the condition is not satisfied, reset the current length and start a new valid subsequence from A[i]. Update 'max_length' whenever the current valid subsequence length exceeds it. After processing all elements, return the value of 'max_length' as the result of the function. Print the output in the required format after calling the function.
