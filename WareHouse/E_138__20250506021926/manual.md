Here's the `manual.md` file for the subsequence checking application:

# Subsequence Checking Application

This application checks if a string `t` is a subsequence of concatenated copies of another string `s`. It efficiently determines the minimum number of copies of `s` required to form `t`.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads two non-empty strings `s` and `t` from the user.
- **Subsequence Checking**: It checks if `t` can be formed as a subsequence from concatenated copies of `s`.
- **Output**: The application outputs the minimum number of copies of `s` needed or indicates if no valid `i` exists.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:

```
# Add any required dependencies here, if applicable
```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` script to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Strings**: When prompted, enter a non-empty string `s` followed by a non-empty string `t`.

   ```
   Please enter a non-empty string s: <your_string_s>
   Please enter a non-empty string t: <your_string_t>
   ```

3. **View Results**: The application will output the minimum number of copies of `s` needed to form `t` or a message indicating that no valid `i` exists.

   ```
   Minimum copies of s needed: <number>
   ```

   or

   ```
   No valid i exists.
   ```

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Please enter a non-empty string s: abc
Please enter a non-empty string t: aabcbc
Minimum copies of s needed: 2
```

## Notes

- Ensure that both strings `s` and `t` are non-empty before running the application.
- The application efficiently handles large strings and checks for subsequences without unnecessary computations.
