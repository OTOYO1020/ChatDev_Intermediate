Task:
Define a function 'canChangeHandles(N: int, S: List[str], T: List[str]) -> bool' to determine if the handle changes can be made without conflicts. Parse the input to extract the number of users 'N', the list of current handles 'S', and the list of desired handles 'T'. Create a data structure (e.g., a set) to keep track of the currently used handles during the change process. Iterate over the list of users and for each user, check if their desired handle 'T[i]' is currently in use. If 'T[i]' is not in use, change the current handle 'S[i]' to 'T[i]' and update the set of used handles. If 'T[i]' is in use, check if there is a previous user whose handle can be changed to free up 'T[i]' without violating the constraints. Implement a mechanism to track the order of handle changes to ensure that all requests can be fulfilled. Return 'True' if all handle changes can be completed successfully, otherwise return 'False'. Handle edge cases where 'N' is at its minimum or maximum limits and ensure performance is optimal. Output the result as a boolean value indicating whether the handle changes can be made without conflicts.
