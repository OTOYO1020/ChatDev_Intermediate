# Handle Change Application

The Handle Change Application allows users to manage and change their handles (usernames) without conflicts. This application ensures that all handle change requests can be fulfilled while adhering to the constraints of handle availability.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Validates the number of users and the corresponding lists of current and desired handles.
- **Handle Management**: Processes handle change requests and ensures that changes can be made without conflicts.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input their data and receive results.

## Quick Install

To run the Handle Change Application, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using `pip`. 

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv handle_change_env
   source handle_change_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `handle_change_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - **Number of Users (N)**: Enter the total number of users.
   - **Current Handles (S)**: Enter the current handles as a comma-separated list (e.g., `user1,user2,user3`).
   - **Desired Handles (T)**: Enter the desired handles as a comma-separated list (e.g., `new_user1,new_user2,new_user3`).

3. **Submit the Data**:
   Click the "Submit" button to process the handle changes. The application will validate the input and determine if the handle changes can be made without conflicts.

4. **View Results**:
   After processing, a message box will display the result:
   - `True`: All handle changes can be completed successfully.
   - `False`: There are conflicts that prevent all handle changes from being fulfilled.

## Example Usage

- **Input**:
  - N: `3`
  - Current Handles (S): `user1,user2,user3`
  - Desired Handles (T): `new_user1,user1,new_user3`

- **Output**:
  - Result: `False` (indicating that the desired handle changes cannot be made without conflicts).

## Edge Cases Handled

- The application checks for:
  - Minimum and maximum limits of N.
  - Proper lengths of the handles lists.
  - Conflicts in handle changes.

## Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:
- `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface.
- No additional external libraries are required at this time.

## Future Enhancements

If you decide to add any external libraries in the future, you can specify them in the `requirements.txt` file using the following format:
```
library_name==version
```
