Task:
Read integer \( N \) from standard input, representing the number of restaurants. Initialize a list to store tuples of the form \((S_i, P_i, i)\) for each restaurant, where \( S_i \) is the city name, \( P_i \) is the score, and \( i \) is the restaurant's identification number. For each restaurant from 1 to \( N \): Read the city name \( S_i \) and score \( P_i \). / Append the tuple \((S_i, P_i, i)\) to the list. Sort the list of tuples primarily by the city name \( S_i \) in lexicographical order. For restaurants with the same city name \( S_i \), sort them by score \( P_i \) in descending order. Extract the identification numbers \( i \) from the sorted list of tuples. Print the identification numbers in the order they appear in the sorted list.
