# Hard-to-Read Checker

A simple application to determine if a given string alternates between uppercase and lowercase letters based on specific criteria.

## Main Functions

The Hard-to-Read Checker application performs the following key functions:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures the input string is between 1 and 1000 characters.
2. **Hard-to-Read Check**: Checks if characters at even indices are uppercase and characters at odd indices are lowercase.
3. **Output Result**: Prints "HARD-TO-READ" if the string meets the criteria, otherwise prints "NOT HARD-TO-READ".

## Installation

To run the Hard-to-Read Checker application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Download the application files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This project relies solely on standard Python libraries, so no additional dependencies are required. However, you can create a virtual environment to keep your project isolated.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Requirements**: If you decide to add any third-party libraries in the future, you can list them in the `requirements.txt` file and install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the Hard-to-Read Checker.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input String**: When prompted, enter a string that you want to check. Ensure that the string length is between 1 and 1000 characters.

3. **View Results**: After entering the string, the application will analyze it and print either "HARD-TO-READ" or "NOT HARD-TO-READ" based on the criteria.

## Example Usage

- **Input**: `AaAaAa`
- **Output**: `HARD-TO-READ`

- **Input**: `AaAaaA`
- **Output**: `NOT HARD-TO-READ`

## Troubleshooting

- **Error Messages**: If you enter an empty string or a string longer than 1000 characters, the application will display an error message indicating the issue.

- **Invalid Input**: Ensure that your input strictly follows the uppercase and lowercase criteria for the application to function correctly.
