Read the string 'S' from standard input. Check the length of 'S' to ensure it is between 1 and 1000 characters. Initialize two boolean flags: 'is_hard_to_read' set to 'True', and 'length' to the length of 'S'. Loop through each character in 'S' using its index:\n   - If the index is even (0-based), check if the character is an uppercase letter:\n     - If not, set 'is_hard_to_read' to 'False' and break the loop.\n   - If the index is odd (0-based), check if the character is a lowercase letter:\n     - If not, set 'is_hard_to_read' to 'False' and break the loop. After the loop, determine the result based on the value of 'is_hard_to_read'. Print 'HARD-TO-READ' if 'is_hard_to_read' is 'True', otherwise print 'NOT HARD-TO-READ'.
