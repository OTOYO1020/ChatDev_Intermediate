Task:
Read the positive integer \( N \) and the string \( S \) from standard input. Check if \( N \) is even; if not, print 'NO' and terminate (since \( S \) cannot be formed by concatenating two identical strings). Calculate the midpoint \( mid = N / 2 \). Split the string \( S \) into two halves: \( first\_half = S[0:mid] \) and \( second\_half = S[mid:N] \). Compare \( first\_half \) and \( second\_half \):\n   - If they are equal, print 'YES'.\n   - If they are not equal, print 'NO'.
