Define the function 'can_select_elements(A, B, C, X)' that takes three sequences A, B, C and a sequence X as input. Parse the input to extract the sequences A, B, C, and X from the provided data. Implement a nested loop to iterate through each combination of elements from A, B, and C. For each combination of elements from A, B, and C, calculate their sum. Check if the calculated sum matches any element in the sequence X. Store the results of the checks in a list or set for efficient lookup. Return a boolean value for each element in X indicating whether a valid combination exists. Ensure that the function handles the constraints of the problem efficiently, especially for large values of Q. Test the function with various input cases to ensure correctness and performance. Output the results in the specified format, indicating for each X_i whether the selection is possible.
