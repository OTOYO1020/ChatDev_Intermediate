# Sequence Combination Checker

A Python application for checking if combinations of elements from three sequences can sum to any element in a target sequence.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this software is `can_select_elements(A, B, C, X)`, which takes four sequences as input:

- **A**: First sequence of integers.
- **B**: Second sequence of integers.
- **C**: Third sequence of integers.
- **X**: Sequence of target sums.

The function checks if any combination of elements from sequences A, B, and C can sum to any element in sequence X. It returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each target sum can be formed.

### Key Features

- Efficiently checks combinations using set operations for fast lookups.
- Handles edge cases, such as empty input sequences.
- Provides user-friendly output indicating whether each target sum is achievable.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application requires no additional libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. If you don't have it yet, you can create the files `main.py` and `utils.py` as provided below.

2. **Create the Files**: Create two files named `main.py` and `utils.py` and copy the following code into them.

   **main.py**
   ```python
   '''
   Main application file for the sequence combination checker.
   '''
   from utils import can_select_elements

   def main():
       try:
           # Input sequences
           A = list(map(int, input("Enter sequence A (comma-separated): ").split(',')))
           B = list(map(int, input("Enter sequence B (comma-separated): ").split(',')))
           C = list(map(int, input("Enter sequence C (comma-separated): ").split(',')))
           X = list(map(int, input("Enter sequence X (comma-separated): ").split(',')))
       except ValueError:
           print("Invalid input. Please enter integers only.")
           return

       # Check combinations
       results = can_select_elements(A, B, C, X)

       # Output results
       for x, res in zip(X, results):
           print(f"{x}: {'Yes' if res else 'No'}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

   **utils.py**
   ```python
   '''
   Utility functions for sequence combination checking.
   '''
   def can_select_elements(A, B, C, X):
       """
       Check if any combination of elements from A, B, and C can sum to any element in X.
       Args:
       A (list): First sequence of integers.
       B (list): Second sequence of integers.
       C (list): Third sequence of integers.
       X (list): Sequence of target sums.
       Returns:
       list: A list of boolean values indicating if each element in X can be formed.
       """
       # Handle edge cases for empty lists
       if not A or not B or not C:
           return [False] * len(X)

       # Create a set of all possible sums from elements in A and B
       possible_sums = {a + b for a in A for b in B}  # Efficiently store sums in a set for O(1) lookup
       results = []

       # For each target sum in X, check if it can be formed by any combination of sums from A and B with elements from C
       for x in X:
           # Check if there exists a sum in possible_sums such that (x - c) is in possible_sums
           results.append(any((x - c) in possible_sums for c in C))  # Using any() for early exit

       return results
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the files are located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the sequences A, B, C, and X as comma-separated integers. For example:

   ```
   Enter sequence A (comma-separated): 1,2,3
   Enter sequence B (comma-separated): 4,5
   Enter sequence C (comma-separated): 6,7
   Enter sequence X (comma-separated): 10,11,12
   ```

5. **View Results**: The application will output whether each target sum in X can be formed by combinations of elements from A, B, and C.

   ```
   10: Yes
   11: Yes
   12: No
   ```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to check combinations of sequences for specific sums. It is efficient and user-friendly, making it suitable for various applications in mathematical problem-solving and algorithm testing.
