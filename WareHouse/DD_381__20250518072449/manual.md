# 1122 Sequence Finder

A Python application to find the maximum length of contiguous subarrays that form a 1122 sequence.

## Overview

The 1122 Sequence Finder is designed to identify the longest contiguous subarray in a list of positive integers where each integer appears exactly twice. This application is useful for analyzing patterns in numerical data and can be integrated into larger data processing workflows.

## Main Functions

- **max_1122_subarray_length(A: List[int]) -> int**: This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the maximum length of any contiguous subarray that is a valid 1122 sequence. If the length of the input list is odd, it returns 0.

## Installation

To run the 1122 Sequence Finder, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You may need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required for this application.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the program.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter a list of positive integers separated by commas. For example:

   ```
   Enter a list of positive integers (comma-separated): 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will output the maximum length of the 1122 sequence found in the input list.

   ```
   Maximum Length of 1122 Sequence: 8
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how the application works:

- **Input**: `1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4`
- **Output**: `Maximum Length of 1122 Sequence: 8`

This indicates that the entire input list forms a valid 1122 sequence.

## Error Handling

If the input is not a valid list of integers, the application will prompt the user to enter a valid list:

```
Please enter a valid list of integers.
```

## Conclusion

The 1122 Sequence Finder is a straightforward yet powerful tool for identifying specific patterns in numerical data. Feel free to modify and extend the application to suit your needs.
