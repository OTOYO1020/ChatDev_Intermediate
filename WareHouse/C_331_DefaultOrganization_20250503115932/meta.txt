Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the sequence A. Read the sequence A of length N from standard input as an array of integers. Initialize an array 'result' of length N to store the sum of elements greater than each A[i]. For each index i from 0 to N-1:\n   - Initialize a variable 'sum_greater' to 0.\n   - For each element A[j] in A where j â‰  i:\n     - If A[j] > A[i], add A[j] to 'sum_greater'.\n   - Assign 'sum_greater' to 'result[i]'. Print the contents of the 'result' array, which contains the sums for each A[i].
