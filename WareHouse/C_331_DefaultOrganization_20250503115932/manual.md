# SumGreaterApp

A simple application to calculate the sum of elements greater than each element in a given sequence of integers.

## Introduction

The SumGreaterApp allows users to input a sequence of integers and calculates the sum of all elements that are greater than each element in the sequence. This application is useful for various numerical analyses and can be easily run in a Python environment.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
- **Calculation**: For each element in the sequence, the app computes the sum of all elements that are greater than that element.
- **Output**: The results are printed in a list format, showing the sum for each element in the sequence.

## Installation

To run the SumGreaterApp, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: The application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

3. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SumGreaterApp
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Length of the Sequence**: When prompted, enter a positive integer representing the length of the sequence.

3. **Input the Sequence**: Enter the integers for the sequence, separated by spaces. Ensure that the number of integers matches the length specified in the previous step.

4. **View the Results**: After entering the sequence, the application will calculate and display the sums of elements greater than each element in the sequence.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the length of the sequence (positive integer): 5
Enter 5 integers (space-separated): 1 2 3 4 5
Result: [14, 12, 9, 5, 0]
```

In this example, the application calculates the following:
- For `1`: Sum of `2, 3, 4, 5` = `14`
- For `2`: Sum of `3, 4, 5` = `12`
- For `3`: Sum of `4, 5` = `9`
- For `4`: Sum of `5` = `5`
- For `5`: Sum of `0` = `0`

## Conclusion

The SumGreaterApp is a straightforward and effective tool for calculating sums based on comparative values in a sequence. For any issues or questions, please refer to the code comments or reach out for support.
