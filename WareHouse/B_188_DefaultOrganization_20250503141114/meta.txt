Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the dimension of the vectors. Initialize two lists, 'A' and 'B', to store the N-dimensional vectors. Read the N integers for vector A from standard input and store them in the list 'A'. Read the N integers for vector B from standard input and store them in the list 'B'. Initialize a variable 'inner_product' to 0 to hold the result of the inner product calculation. Loop through the range from 0 to N-1:\n   - For each index i, compute the product of 'A[i]' and 'B[i]' and add it to 'inner_product'. After the loop, check if 'inner_product' is equal to 0. If 'inner_product' is 0, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'. Ensure that the input values are within the specified constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 and -100 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ 100. Handle any potential input errors gracefully, ensuring that only valid integers are processed.
