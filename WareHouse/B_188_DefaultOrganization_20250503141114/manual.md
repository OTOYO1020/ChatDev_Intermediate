# Vector Inner Product Application

A simple application to compute the inner product of two N-dimensional vectors. This application reads vectors from user input, calculates their inner product, and determines if the result is zero.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to input the dimension of the vectors (N) and the elements of vectors A and B.
- **Inner Product Calculation**: It computes the inner product of the two vectors using the formula:
  
  \[
  \text{inner\_product} = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A[i] \times B[i]
  \]

- **Output**: The application outputs "YES" if the inner product is zero, and "NO" otherwise.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Vector Inner Product application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the application files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vector-inner-product.git
cd vector-inner-product
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

This application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

### Step 3: Run the Application

You can run the application using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Input the Dimension**: When prompted, enter the dimension of the vectors (N). Ensure that \(1 \leq N \leq 100000\).

   ```
   Enter the dimension of vectors (N): 3
   ```

2. **Input Vector A**: Enter the elements of vector A as space-separated integers. Ensure that each element is within the range of -100 to 100.

   ```
   Enter vector A (space-separated integers): 1 2 3
   ```

3. **Input Vector B**: Enter the elements of vector B in the same manner.

   ```
   Enter vector B (space-separated integers): -1 -2 -3
   ```

4. **View the Result**: The application will calculate the inner product and display "YES" if the result is zero, or "NO" otherwise.

   ```
   NO
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the dimension N is not within the specified range.
- If the number of elements in vectors A or B does not match N.
- If any element in vectors A or B is outside the allowed range of -100 to 100.
- If the input is not a valid integer.

In case of an error, the application will prompt the user to re-enter the values.

## Conclusion

This Vector Inner Product application is a straightforward tool for calculating the inner product of two vectors. It is designed to handle user input gracefully and provide clear feedback on the results. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
