A numeric string S of length 4 is given as standard input. Split numeric string S into the first 2 characters and the last 2 characters, and store them in the former and latter arguments. Then call the convert function with these as arguments.Define the details of the convert function as follows. Check whether the two arguments are between 1 and 12 inclusive. If both arguments meet the condition, output AMBIGUOUS. If neither meets the condition, output NA. If only the first argument meets the condition, output MMYY, and if only the second argument meets the condition, output YYMM.
