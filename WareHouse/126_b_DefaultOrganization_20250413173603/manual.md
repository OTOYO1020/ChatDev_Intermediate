# Numeric String Processor

A simple application for processing a 4-digit numeric string to determine its validity based on specific criteria.

## Overview

This software takes a 4-digit numeric string as input, splits it into two parts (the first two digits and the last two digits), and evaluates these parts to determine if they fall within a specified range (1 to 12). The output will indicate whether the input is ambiguous, valid in one format, or invalid.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Accepts a 4-digit numeric string from the user.
- **String Splitting**: Divides the input string into two parts: the first two characters and the last two characters.
- **Conversion Logic**: Evaluates the two parts to determine:
  - "AMBIGUOUS" if both parts are valid (1-12).
  - "MMYY" if only the first part is valid (1-12).
  - "YYMM" if only the second part is valid (1-12).
  - "NA" if neither part is valid.

## Installation

To run the Numeric String Processor, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any required dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: Currently, there are no additional dependencies required for this software.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located, and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Numeric String**: When prompted, enter a 4-digit numeric string (e.g., `1234`). The application will validate your input.

3. **View the Result**: After entering a valid string, the application will process the input and display the result based on the conversion logic.

## Example Usage

- **Input**: `1234`
  - **Output**: `MMYY` (if `12` is valid and `34` is not)
  
- **Input**: `1212`
  - **Output**: `AMBIGUOUS` (both `12` and `12` are valid)
  
- **Input**: `0000`
  - **Output**: `NA` (neither part is valid)

## Troubleshooting

- **Input Error**: If you enter a string that is not 4 digits, you will be prompted to try again, up to a maximum of 3 attempts.
- **Exceeding Attempts**: If you exceed the maximum number of attempts, the program will exit.

## Conclusion

This Numeric String Processor is a straightforward tool for evaluating numeric strings based on specified criteria. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy for users to validate their inputs quickly.
