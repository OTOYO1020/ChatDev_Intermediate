Task:
Define the function 'count_connected_red_paintings(N: int, K: int, S: List[str]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where N is the size of the grid, K is the number of squares to paint red, and S is the list of strings representing the grid. Parse the input to extract the values of N, K, and the grid S from the input format. Implement a function to identify all white squares ('.') in the grid and store their coordinates in a list. Generate all combinations of K white squares from the list of identified white squares. For each combination of K squares, check if they form a connected component using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Count the number of valid combinations that satisfy the connectivity condition. Return the count of valid combinations as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when K is greater than the number of available white squares. Implement unit tests to verify the correctness of the function with various grid configurations. Output the result as an integer representing the number of ways to paint the grid.
