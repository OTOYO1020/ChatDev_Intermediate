Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of players. Initialize a list 'results' to store the win counts for each player. For each player i from 1 to N:\n   - Read the string 'S_i' from standard input, which contains the match results for player i.\n   - Count the number of wins (character 'o') in 'S_i' and store it in 'results[i-1]'. Create a list of tuples 'players' where each tuple contains (win_count, player_number) for each player. Sort the 'players' list in descending order by win_count and then by player_number in ascending order. Extract the sorted player numbers from the 'players' list into a new list 'ranked_players'. Print the 'ranked_players' list as the final output.
