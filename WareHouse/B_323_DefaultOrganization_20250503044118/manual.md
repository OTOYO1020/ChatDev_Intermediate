## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Player Ranking System allows users to input match results for multiple players and ranks them based on the number of wins. Each playerâ€™s results are represented as a string, where 'o' indicates a win and 'x' indicates a loss. The system counts the wins for each player and sorts them accordingly.

### Main Functions

- **Input Player Count**: The system prompts the user to enter the number of players.
- **Input Match Results**: For each player, the user can input a string representing the match results.
- **Count Wins**: The system counts the number of wins for each player based on the input strings.
- **Rank Players**: Players are ranked based on their win counts in descending order, with ties broken by player number in ascending order.
- **Output Rankings**: The final ranked list of players is displayed.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Enter the Number of Players**: When prompted, enter a positive integer representing the number of players.

   ```
   Enter the number of players (positive integer): 3
   ```

3. **Input Match Results**: For each player, input their match results as a string of 'o' and 'x'.

   ```
   Enter match results for player 1 (string of 'o' for wins and 'x' for losses): ooxx
   Enter match results for player 2 (string of 'o' for wins and 'x' for losses): ooo
   Enter match results for player 3 (string of 'o' for wins and 'x' for losses): oxox
   ```

4. **View Ranked Players**: After all inputs, the system will display the ranked players based on their win counts.

   ```
   Ranked Players: [2, 1, 3]
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the number of players is not a positive integer, the system will prompt the user to enter a valid number.
- If any match result string is empty or contains invalid characters (anything other than 'o' or 'x'), the system will notify the user and terminate.
