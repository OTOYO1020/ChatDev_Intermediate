Task:
Define a function 'max_volume_cuboid(L: int) -> float' to calculate the maximum volume of a rectangular cuboid given the sum of its dimensions L. Implement input handling to read the integer L from standard input. Ensure that the input L is within the constraints 1 ≤ L ≤ 1000. Calculate the dimensions of the cuboid using the formula for maximum volume, which occurs when the dimensions are equal (L/3, L/3, L/3). Compute the volume using the formula 'volume = (L/3) * (L/3) * (L/3)'. Return the computed volume as a float value from the function. Implement output handling to print the volume with appropriate formatting. Test the function with various values of L to ensure correctness. Handle edge cases, such as L being exactly 1 or 1000, to verify the function's robustness. Document the function and its parameters clearly for future reference.
