# Cuboid Volume Calculator

Calculate the maximum volume of a rectangular cuboid given the sum of its dimensions.

## Overview

The Cuboid Volume Calculator is a simple command-line application that allows users to compute the maximum volume of a cuboid based on the sum of its dimensions (L). The maximum volume occurs when the dimensions are as equal as possible. This application is designed to handle user input, validate it, and return the calculated volume in a user-friendly format.

## Main Functions

- **max_volume_cuboid(L: int) -> float**: This function calculates the maximum volume of a cuboid given the sum of its dimensions L. It ensures that L is within the range of 1 to 1000 and computes the volume based on the formula for maximum volume.

## Installation

To run the Cuboid Volume Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file, and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Sum of Dimensions**: When prompted, enter an integer value for L (the sum of the dimensions). Ensure that the value is within the range of 1 to 1000.

3. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and display the maximum volume of the cuboid formatted to two decimal places.

### Example

- Input: `Enter the sum of dimensions (L): 9`
- Output: `Max Volume: 8.00`

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for invalid inputs. If you enter a value for L that is outside the range of 1 to 1000, the application will display an error message:
```
Input Error: L must be between 1 and 1000.
```

## Testing

To ensure the correctness of the function, you can test it with various values of L, including edge cases such as:

- L = 1
- L = 1000
- L = 3
- L = 6

## Conclusion

The Cuboid Volume Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating the maximum volume of a cuboid based on the sum of its dimensions. With its simple command-line interface and robust error handling, it is user-friendly and effective for educational and practical purposes.
