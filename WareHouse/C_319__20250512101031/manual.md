# Takahashi Probability Calculator

A simple application to calculate the probability of Takahashi not getting disappointed based on a 3x3 grid of integers.

## Main Functions

The Takahashi Probability Calculator includes the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Accepts a 3x3 grid of integers from the user, ensuring that all values are between 1 and 9.
2. **Disappointment Check**: Evaluates if Takahashi will be disappointed based on the arrangement of numbers in the grid.
3. **Probability Calculation**: Computes the probability of Takahashi not getting disappointed by analyzing all possible arrangements of the grid.
4. **Validation**: Ensures that the grid adheres to the constraints that no row, column, or diagonal contains the same number in all three cells.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Probability Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the required libraries (if any) using:

```bash
pip install collections
pip install math
pip install itertools
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Grid**: The application will prompt you to enter the values for the 3x3 grid. Input three integers for each row, separated by spaces. Ensure that all integers are between 1 and 9.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter row 1 (3 integers separated by space): 1 2 3
   Enter row 2 (3 integers separated by space): 4 5 6
   Enter row 3 (3 integers separated by space): 7 8 9
   ```

3. **View the Result**: After entering the grid, the application will calculate and display the probability of Takahashi not getting disappointed, formatted to four decimal places.

   Example output:
   ```
   Probability of not getting disappointed: 0.1234
   ```

## Edge Cases

The application is designed to handle various edge cases, including:

- All numbers being the same.
- Invalid grid configurations (e.g., duplicates in rows, columns, or diagonals).
- Non-integer inputs or integers outside the range of 1 to 9.

If the input is invalid, the application will prompt you to re-enter the values.

## Testing the Functionality

You can test the application with various grid configurations to validate its correctness and adherence to the problem constraints. Ensure to try edge cases to see how the application responds.

## Conclusion

The Takahashi Probability Calculator is a straightforward tool for evaluating grid arrangements and their impact on Takahashi's disappointment. With proper input handling and validation, it provides accurate probability calculations based on user-defined grids.
