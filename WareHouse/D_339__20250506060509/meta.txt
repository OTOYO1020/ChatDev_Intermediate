Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the size of the grid (N x N). Read N strings \( S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N \) from standard input, representing the grid configuration. Initialize a list 'players' to store the coordinates of the two players found in the grid. Iterate through each string \( S_i \) to locate the positions of the players:\n   - For each character in \( S_i \):\n     - If the character is 'P', append the coordinates (i, j) to the 'players' list. Check if the length of 'players' is exactly 2; if not, print '-1' and terminate. Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid:\n   - Use a queue to track the positions of both players and the number of moves taken.\n   - For each position, attempt to move in all four directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - Ensure that moves are only made to empty cells ('.') and not to obstacles ('#'). During the BFS, check if both players reach the same cell:\n   - If they do, record the number of moves taken and terminate the search. If the BFS completes without finding a common cell, print '-1'. If a common cell is found, print the minimum number of moves required for both players to meet.
