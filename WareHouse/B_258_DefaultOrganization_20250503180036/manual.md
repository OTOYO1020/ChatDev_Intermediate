# Max Number Finder

A Python application designed to find the maximum integer that can be formed by traversing a grid of digits in various directions.

## Main Functions

The Max Number Finder application includes the following key functions:

- **get_grid()**: Reads the size of the grid \( N \) and populates the grid \( A \) with \( N \times N \) integers from standard input. It ensures that all inputs are valid digits (0-9) and that each row contains exactly \( N \) integers.

- **get_max_number(start_row, start_col, direction)**: Simulates movement in the specified direction from a starting position in the grid for \( N-1 \) steps, collecting digits along the way. It converts the collected digits into an integer and returns the value.

- **calculate_max_number(grid)**: Iterates over all possible starting positions in the grid and all eight possible directions, calling `get_max_number` for each combination. It keeps track of the maximum integer value obtained and returns it.

## Installation

To run the Max Number Finder application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Max Number Finder application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. You can run the application directly without additional installations.

## Usage

To use the Max Number Finder application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py`.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Grid Size**: When prompted, enter the size of the grid \( N \) (a positive integer).

   ```
   Enter the size of the grid (N):
   ```

3. **Input the Grid Values**: Enter \( N \) rows of \( N \) space-separated integers (digits between 0 and 9). Ensure that each row contains exactly \( N \) integers.

   ```
   Enter the grid (space-separated rows):
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After entering the grid, the application will calculate and print the maximum integer value that can be formed by traversing the grid.

   ```
   Output: 987654321
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the application:

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input:

   ```
   Enter the size of the grid (N): 3
   Enter the grid (space-separated rows):
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   ```

3. Output:

   ```
   987654321
   ```
