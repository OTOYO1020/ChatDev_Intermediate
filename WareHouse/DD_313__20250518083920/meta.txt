Task:
Receive the integers N and K from Standard Input. Validate that K is an odd number and 1 ≤ K < N ≤ 1000. Initialize an empty list A of length N to store the determined values of the sequence. Set a counter for the number of queries made, ensuring it does not exceed N. While the sequence A is not fully determined, select K distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_K from the range 1 to N. Print the query in the format '? x_1 x_2 ... x_K' to Standard Output. Receive the response T from Standard Input, which indicates the parity of the sum of the selected elements. If T is -1, terminate the program immediately as the query was invalid. Update the list A based on the responses received to ensure it remains consistent with the queries. Once A is fully determined, print the sequence in the format '! A_1 A_2 ... A_N' and terminate the program.
