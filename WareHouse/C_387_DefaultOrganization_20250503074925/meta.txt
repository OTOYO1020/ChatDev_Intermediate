Task:
Read the integers L and R from standard input. Initialize a counter variable 'snake_count' to 0 to keep track of the number of Snake numbers. Loop through each integer 'num' from L to R (inclusive). For each 'num', convert it to a string to access its digits. Identify the most significant digit (first character of the string) and convert it to an integer 'top_digit'. Initialize a boolean variable 'is_snake' to True. Loop through the remaining digits of 'num':\n   - If any digit is greater than or equal to 'top_digit', set 'is_snake' to False and break the loop. If 'is_snake' is still True after checking all digits, increment 'snake_count' by 1. After the loop, print the value of 'snake_count' as the result. Ensure that the solution handles large ranges efficiently, considering the constraints of L and R up to \(10^{18}\).
