# Snake Number Counting Application

This application is designed to count the number of "Snake numbers" within a specified range of integers. A Snake number is defined as a number where all digits after the most significant digit are less than it.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads two integers, L and R, from standard input.
- **Snake Number Calculation**: It counts the number of Snake numbers in the range [L, R] using optimized algorithms to handle large ranges efficiently.
- **Output**: The application prints the total count of Snake numbers found in the specified range.

## Installation

To run the Snake Number Counting application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run Python scripts.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the values for L and R:
   ```
   Enter L: <your_value>
   Enter R: <your_value>
   ```

   - Ensure that L and R are non-negative integers and that L is less than or equal to R.

3. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will process the input and display the count of Snake numbers in the specified range:
   ```
   Snake Numbers Count: <count>
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the range:
   ```
   Enter L: 10
   Enter R: 50
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   Snake Numbers Count: 31
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for input validation. If you enter invalid values (e.g., negative numbers or L greater than R), you will receive an error message:
```
Input Error: L and R should be non-negative integers.
```

## Conclusion

This Snake Number Counting application provides an efficient way to count specific types of numbers within a given range. It is designed to handle large inputs effectively, making it suitable for various applications in number theory and computational mathematics.
