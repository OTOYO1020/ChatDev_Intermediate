Read the characters \( S_1, S_2, T_1, T_2 \) from standard input, ensuring that they are one of the characters from the set \{A, B, C, D, E\}. Validate that \( S_1 \) is not equal to \( S_2 \) and \( T_1 \) is not equal to \( T_2 \). Define the coordinates for the vertices of the regular pentagon \( P \) corresponding to the characters A, B, C, D, and E. Create a function 'get_coordinates(vertex)' that returns the coordinates of the vertex based on the character input. Call 'get_coordinates(S_1)' and 'get_coordinates(S_2)' to obtain the coordinates of points \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \). Call 'get_coordinates(T_1)' and 'get_coordinates(T_2)' to obtain the coordinates of points \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \). Calculate the length of the line segment connecting points \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) using the distance formula. Calculate the length of the line segment connecting points \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) using the distance formula. Compare the lengths of the two segments and determine if they are equal. Print 'YES' if the lengths are equal, otherwise print 'NO'.
