Define the function 'max_blue_jewels(N: int, X: int, Y: int) -> int' to calculate the maximum number of blue jewels of level 1. Implement input handling to read integers N, X, and Y from standard input. Check if N is less than 1 or greater than 10, and if so, return 0 as an invalid case. Create a recursive or iterative function to simulate the conversion of red jewels to blue jewels, starting from level N. In the conversion process, ensure that when converting a red jewel of level n, the function adds X blue jewels of level n to the total count. When converting a blue jewel of level n, ensure that the function adds Y blue jewels of level (n-1) to the total count. Keep track of the total number of blue jewels of level 1 obtained through all possible conversions. Implement a base case for the recursion or termination condition for the iteration when reaching level 1. Return the total count of blue jewels of level 1 from the function. Implement output handling to print the result of the maximum number of blue jewels of level 1.
