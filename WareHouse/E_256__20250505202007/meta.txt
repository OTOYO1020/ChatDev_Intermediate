Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of people. Initialize an array 'X' of size N to store the disliked person indices for each person. Initialize an array 'C' of size N to store the frustration values for each person. Read N pairs of integers (X_i, C_i) from standard input and populate the arrays 'X' and 'C'. Create a directed graph where each person i has a directed edge to their disliked person X_i. Perform a topological sort on the graph to determine a valid order of giving candies that minimizes frustration. Initialize a variable 'total_frustration' to 0 to accumulate the total frustration. Traverse the sorted order and calculate the frustration for each person based on the order of candy distribution. Update 'total_frustration' with the calculated frustration values. Print the minimum possible sum of frustration, 'total_frustration'.
