Define the function 'calculate_xor_distances(N: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of vertices and edges is a list of tuples containing (u_i, v_i, w_i). Parse the input to extract the number of vertices N and the list of edges, ensuring that the edges are stored as tuples of (u_i, v_i, w_i). Construct the tree using an adjacency list representation from the edges provided. Implement a function to perform Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to compute the XOR distance for each pair of vertices (i, j). For each pair of vertices (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N, calculate the XOR of the weights along the path between them. Accumulate the XOR distances for all pairs (i, j) and maintain a running total. Apply the modulo operation with (10^9 + 7) to the accumulated total to handle large numbers. Return the final result as the output of the function 'calculate_xor_distances'. Ensure that all edge cases, such as minimum and maximum values of N, are handled correctly. Output the result in the specified format, ensuring it is an integer.
