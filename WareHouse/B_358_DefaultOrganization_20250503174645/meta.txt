Task:
Read the integer values of N (number of people) and A (time taken per person to purchase a ticket) from standard input. Read the arrival times T_i for each person (where i ranges from 1 to N) into an array 'arrival_times'. Initialize a variable 'current_time' to track the time when the ticket booth becomes available for the next person. Loop through each person from 1 to N:\n   - If 'current_time' is less than 'arrival_times[i-1]', set 'current_time' to 'arrival_times[i-1]' (the person starts immediately upon arrival).\n   - Calculate the finish time for the i-th person as 'current_time + A'.\n   - Update 'current_time' to this finish time for the next iteration. Store the finish times in an array 'finish_times'. Print the finish times for each person in 'finish_times' as output.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that we handle the input correctly, process the ticket purchasing logic, and provide the required output format.
