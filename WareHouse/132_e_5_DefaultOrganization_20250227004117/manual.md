# Graph Shortest Path Finder

This software provides an efficient way to find the shortest path in a transformed graph structure using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The graph is expanded into a three-layer structure, allowing for unique state transitions based on modulo 3.

## Main Functions

1. **Graph Representation**: The software represents a graph using an adjacency list, allowing for efficient edge traversal.
2. **Graph Transformation**: Each vertex is expanded into three states: (v,0), (v,1), and (v,2). This transformation enables transitions between states based on original edges.
3. **Shortest Path Search**: The BFS algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path from a starting vertex S to a target vertex T, considering the transformed graph structure.
4. **Output**: The software outputs the minimum number of moves required to reach the target vertex or -1 if no valid path exists.

## Installation

To run the software, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## Usage

1. **Input Format**: The software expects input via standard input in the following format:
   - The first line contains two integers, N (number of vertices) and M (number of edges).
   - The next M lines each contain two integers representing an edge (u, v).
   - The last line contains two integers representing the starting vertex S and the target vertex T.

   Example Input:
   ```
   5 6
   1 2
   1 3
   2 4
   3 4
   4 5
   1 5
   ```

2. **Running the Software**: You can run the software by executing the `main.py` file. Make sure to provide the input in the specified format.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

   Where `input.txt` contains the input data as described above.

3. **Output**: The program will print the shortest distance divided by three or -1 if no valid path exists.

## Example

Given the following input:
```
5 6
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 4
4 5
1 5
```

The output will be:
```
1
```

This indicates that the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 5 requires 1 move in the transformed graph structure.

## Performance

The implementation is optimized to run in O(N + M) time complexity, making it efficient for large graphs with constraints up to N, M â‰¤ 10^5.

## Conclusion

This software provides a robust solution for finding the shortest path in a transformed graph structure. By leveraging BFS and a unique three-layer state representation, it efficiently determines the minimum moves required to navigate from a starting vertex to a target vertex.
