Task:
Both input and output are assumed to be performed via standard input and standard output, so don't create any GUI. Also, be mindful of not creating unnecessary variables and functions. Read the number of vertices N and edges M from standard input. Read the edges as pairs of vertices (ui, vi). Read the starting vertex S and the target vertex T. Store these values in an appropriate data structure.Transform the graph into a three-layer structure Convert each vertex into three states based on modulo 3. Expand each vertex v into three nodes: (v,0), (v,1), and (v,2). Use the original edges to define transitions between these states.Implement the shortest path search using BFS Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on the transformed graph. Start from node (S,0) and search for the shortest path to node (T,0). Since each move consists of three steps, divide the BFS result by three to get the minimum number of moves.Determine and output the result If BFS finds a path to (T,0), output the shortest distance divided by three. If no valid path exists, output -1.Optimize and verify computational complexity Ensure the implementation runs in O(N + M) time complexity. Verify its efficiency under the given constraints (N, M â‰¤ 10^5).
