# Contest Rating Calculator

A software application designed to calculate the maximum rating based on contest performance values.

## Overview

The Contest Rating Calculator allows users to input the number of contests and their respective performance values. It computes the maximum rating based on a specific formula that considers the performance values and the number of contests chosen. This tool is particularly useful for participants who want to evaluate their performance across multiple contests.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of contests and their performance values from the user.
- **Rating Calculation**: Computes the maximum rating based on the provided performance values using a defined formula.
- **Edge Case Management**: Handles scenarios where there is only one contest by returning its performance directly.
- **Validation**: Ensures that performance values are integers within the specified range (0 to 3000).

## Installation

To run the Contest Rating Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. If you have the files, ensure they are in the same directory.

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application uses the `itertools` and `math` libraries, which are included in the Python standard library. No additional installations are required.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

2. **Execute the Script**: Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of contests (N).
   - Next, input the performance values for each contest as space-separated integers.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of contests: 3
   Enter performance values (space-separated): 1500 1600 1700
   ```

4. **View Results**: After processing, the application will display the maximum rating calculated based on the input performance values.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Max Rating: 1450.75
   ```

## Edge Cases

- If you enter `1` for the number of contests, the application will directly return the performance of that single contest.
- If the input performance values do not match the specified number of contests, an error message will be displayed.

## Example

Here’s a quick example of how to use the software:

1. Start the application.
2. Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of contests: 2
   Enter performance values (space-separated): 2000 2500
   ```
3. Output:
   ```
   Max Rating: 1800.00
   ```

## Conclusion

The Contest Rating Calculator is a straightforward tool for evaluating contest performances. By following the instructions above, users can easily install and utilize the software to gain insights into their contest ratings.
