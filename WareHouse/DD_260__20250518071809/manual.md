# Card Game Application

A fun and interactive card game that simulates the process of drawing cards and determining which cards are eaten based on specific rules.

## Main Functions

The application consists of two main components:

1. **Game Logic**: The core functionality that determines which cards are eaten based on the rules provided.
2. **User Interface**: A command-line interface that allows users to input the number of cards, the threshold for eating cards, and the list of cards.

### Key Features

- Input the number of cards and their values.
- Set a threshold for how many cards need to be face-up before they are considered eaten.
- Track which cards are eaten and which remain uneaten.

## Installation

To run the Card Game Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

   Note: The `typing` module is included in the standard library for Python 3.5 and later, so you may not need to install it separately.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where your `main.py` file is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:

   - **Number of Cards (N)**: Enter an integer representing the total number of cards.
   - **Threshold for Eating Cards (K)**: Enter an integer that specifies how many face-up cards must be present to be considered eaten.
   - **List of Cards (P)**: Enter a comma-separated list of integers representing the card values.

   Example input:
   ```
   Number of Cards (N): 5
   Threshold for Eating Cards (K): 3
   List of Cards (P) - comma separated: 2, 5, 3, 1, 4
   ```

3. **View Results**: After processing the input, the application will display the moves at which cards were eaten. If no cards were eaten, it will inform you accordingly.

   Example output:
   ```
   Eaten Moves: 2, 3
   ```

## Conclusion

The Card Game Application provides an engaging way to simulate card drawing and determine which cards are eaten based on user-defined rules. Enjoy playing and experimenting with different card values and thresholds!
