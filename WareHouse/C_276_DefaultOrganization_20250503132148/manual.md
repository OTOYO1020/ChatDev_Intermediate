# Permutation Generator

A Python application for generating and retrieving the K-th lexicographically smallest permutation of a given sequence.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a permutation of integers and retrieve the K-th smallest permutation in lexicographical order. It includes validation checks to ensure the input is correct and provides error messages for invalid inputs.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers N (length of the permutation) and K (the K-th permutation to retrieve) from standard input.
- **Validation**: Checks if the permutation P is not the identity permutation and validates the values of N and K.
- **Permutation Generation**: Generates all permutations of the sequence (1, 2, ..., N).
- **Sorting**: Sorts the generated permutations in lexicographical order.
- **Output**: Prints the (K-1)-th permutation as a sequence of integers.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application requires the following Python libraries:

- `itertools`: This is part of the Python standard library, so no installation is needed.
- `math`: Also part of the standard library.

You can check if you have Python installed by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If you need to install Python, follow the instructions on the official website.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the values for N, K, and the permutation P. The input should be formatted as follows:

   ```
   N K
   P1 P2 P3 ... PN
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   3 2
   3 1 2
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will print the (K-1)-th lexicographically smallest permutation of the sequence (1, 2, ..., N).

## Example Usage

To illustrate how the application works, consider the following example:

### Input
```
4 3
2 1 4 3
```

### Output
```
2 3 1 4
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various scenarios:

- If N is less than 1, it will print an error message.
- If the length of P does not match N, it will print an error message.
- If P is the identity permutation, it will print an error message.
- If K is out of bounds, it will print an error message.
- If the input format is invalid, it will print an error message.

## Conclusion

This Permutation Generator is a simple yet powerful tool for working with permutations in Python. It provides a clear interface for users to generate and retrieve permutations while ensuring input validity. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
