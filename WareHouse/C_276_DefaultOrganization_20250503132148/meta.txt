Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input, where N is the length of the permutation and K indicates the K-th lexicographically smallest permutation. Read the permutation P as an array of integers from standard input. Validate that the permutation P is not equal to the identity permutation (1, 2, ..., N). Generate all permutations of the sequence (1, 2, ..., N) using a function 'generate_permutations()'. Sort the generated permutations in lexicographical order using a function 'sort_permutations(permutations)'. Identify the (K-1)-th permutation from the sorted list of permutations. Store the result in a variable 'result_permutation'. Print the 'result_permutation' as the output in the required format.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function: 'generate_permutations()', 'sort_permutations(permutations)'\n- Variable: 'N', 'K', 'P', 'result_permutation'\n\n### Input Format:\n- The input consists of two integers N and K followed by a permutation P of length N.\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output is the (K-1)-th lexicographically smallest permutation printed as a sequence of integers.
