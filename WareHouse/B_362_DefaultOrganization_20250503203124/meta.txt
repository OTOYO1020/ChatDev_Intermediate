Task:
Read the integer coordinates \( x_A, y_A, x_B, y_B, x_C, y_C \) from standard input. Store the points as tuples: 'point_A = (x_A, y_A)', 'point_B = (x_B, y_B)', and 'point_C = (x_C, y_C)'. Calculate the squared lengths of the sides of triangle \( ABC \):\n   - 'AB_squared = (x_B - x_A) ** 2 + (y_B - y_A) ** 2'\n   - 'BC_squared = (x_C - x_B) ** 2 + (y_C - y_B) ** 2'\n   - 'CA_squared = (x_A - x_C) ** 2 + (y_A - y_C) ** 2' Check for the right triangle condition using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   - If 'AB_squared + BC_squared == CA_squared', then triangle \( ABC \) is a right triangle.\n   - If 'AB_squared + CA_squared == BC_squared', then triangle \( ABC \) is a right triangle.\n   - If 'BC_squared + CA_squared == AB_squared', then triangle \( ABC \) is a right triangle. Store the result as a boolean variable 'is_right_triangle'. Print 'YES' if 'is_right_triangle' is true, otherwise print 'NO'.
