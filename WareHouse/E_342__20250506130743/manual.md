# Train Scheduler

A software application designed to compute the latest arrival times for trains between various stations.

## Overview

The Train Scheduler allows users to input information about train schedules and calculate the latest possible arrival times at a destination station from various starting stations. This application is particularly useful for transportation planning and scheduling.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Train Information**: Users can input the number of stations and train schedules, including departure and arrival times.
2. **Calculate Latest Arrival Times**: The application computes the latest time to arrive at the destination station from any starting station based on the provided train schedules.
3. **Output Results**: The results are printed for each station, showing the latest arrival time at the destination station.

## Installation

To run the Train Scheduler, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Train Scheduler code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install any required dependencies. The current implementation does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: If there is no `requirements.txt`, you can skip this step.)*

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the number of stations (N) and the number of train information pieces (M) in the format:

   ```
   Enter number of stations and train information (N M): 5 3
   ```

3. **Enter Train Information**: For each piece of train information, input the details in the format `(l_i, d_i, k_i, c_i, A_i, B_i)`. For example:

   ```
   Enter train info (l_i, d_i, k_i, c_i, A_i, B_i): 1 2 3 10 5 15
   ```

   Repeat this step for all M pieces of information.

4. **View Results**: After entering all the data, the application will compute and print the latest arrival times for each station from 1 to N-1.

   ```
   Latest arrival time from station 1 to station 5: 15
   Latest arrival time from station 2 to station 5: 12
   ...
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the Train Scheduler:

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the number of stations and train information:

   ```
   Enter number of stations and train information (N M): 4 2
   ```

3. Input the train information:

   ```
   Enter train info (l_i, d_i, k_i, c_i, A_i, B_i): 1 1 2 5 0 10
   Enter train info (l_i, d_i, k_i, c_i, A_i, B_i): 1 2 3 10 5 15
   ```

4. View the results:

   ```
   Latest arrival time from station 1 to station 4: 15
   Latest arrival time from station 2 to station 4: 10
   Latest arrival time from station 3 to station 4: -1
   ```

## Conclusion

The Train Scheduler is a powerful tool for managing train schedules and optimizing arrival times. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
