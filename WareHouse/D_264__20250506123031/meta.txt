Task:
Read the input string 'S' from standard input, ensuring it is a permutation of the string atcoder. Initialize a variable 'operations' to count the number of adjacent swaps needed. Create a target string 'target = atcoder' for comparison. Loop through the characters of the string 'S' and the 'target':\n   - For each character in 'target', find its index in 'S'.\n   - If the character is not in the correct position, swap it with the adjacent character to the right until it reaches its correct position.\n   - Increment the 'operations' counter for each swap performed. Repeat the process until the entire string 'S' matches the 'target'. Print the final value of 'operations' as the minimum number of swaps required to transform 'S' into atcoder.
