# Username Finder

A simple application to generate valid usernames based on given strings and a list of taken usernames.

## Main Functions

The Username Finder application provides the following main functionalities:

- **Generate Usernames**: Create potential usernames by generating all permutations of a list of strings and concatenating them with underscores.
- **Validation**: Ensure that generated usernames are not already taken and fall within the specified length constraints (3 to 16 characters).
- **User-Friendly Output**: Return a valid username or indicate failure with a '-1' response.

## Installation

To run the Username Finder application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Follow the steps below:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

   Note: The `itertools` module is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required for it.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Import the Module**: You can use the `UsernameGenerator` class from the `username_generator.py` module in your Python script.

2. **Create an Instance**: Instantiate the `UsernameGenerator` class.

3. **Call the `find_username` Method**: Use the `find_username` method to generate a username. Provide the following parameters:
   - `N`: An integer representing the number of strings in the list `S`.
   - `S`: A list of strings from which to generate usernames.
   - `M`: An integer representing the number of taken usernames in the list `T`.
   - `T`: A list of strings representing taken usernames.

4. **Example Usage**:

   Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet demonstrating how to use the application:

   ```python
   from username_generator import UsernameGenerator

   # Define your inputs
   N = 3
   S = ["user", "name", "test"]
   M = 2
   T = ["user_name", "test_user"]

   # Create an instance of UsernameGenerator
   generator = UsernameGenerator()

   # Find a valid username
   valid_username = generator.find_username(N, S, M, T)

   # Print the result
   print(valid_username)  # Output could be a valid username or '-1'
   ```

5. **Output**: The application will return a valid username if found, or '-1' if no valid username can be generated.

## Conclusion

The Username Finder application is a straightforward tool for generating unique usernames based on user-defined strings. It ensures that the generated usernames are valid and not already taken, making it a useful utility for applications requiring user registration or account creation.
