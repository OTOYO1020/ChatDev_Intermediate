Define a function 'find_username(N: int, S: List[str], M: int, T: List[str]) -> str' to encapsulate the logic for finding a valid username. Parse the input to extract integers N and M, and lists S and T from the input format. Generate all permutations of the list S to explore different orderings of the strings. For each permutation, concatenate the strings with at least one underscore '_' between them to form potential usernames. Ensure that the length of each generated username X is between 3 and 16 characters, inclusive. Check that the generated username X does not match any of the strings in the list T. If a valid username X is found, return it; otherwise, continue checking other permutations. If no valid username is found after checking all permutations, return '-1'. Implement a helper function to check if a generated username is valid against the list T. Format the output as a single string, either the valid username or '-1'.
