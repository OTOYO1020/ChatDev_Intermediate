# Sum Pairs Calculator

A Python application for calculating the sum of products of pairs from a list of integers.

## Overview

The Sum Pairs Calculator allows users to input a list of integers and computes the cumulative sum of products of all unique pairs (i, j) where \(1 \leq i < j \leq N\). The result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of integers \(N\) and the list of integers \(A\) from standard input.
- **Error Handling**: Validates input constraints for \(N\) and the elements of \(A\).
- **Calculation**: Computes the sum of products of pairs efficiently.
- **Output**: Displays the result of the calculation.

## Installation

To run the Sum Pairs Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application requires no external libraries beyond the standard Python library.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of integers \(N\) and the list of integers \(A\):
   - Enter the number of integers (N): `5`
   - Enter integers (space-separated): `1 2 3 4 5`

4. **View Result**: The application will calculate and display the sum of products of pairs.

## Example Input/Output

### Input
```
Enter the number of integers (N): 5
Enter integers (space-separated): 1 2 3 4 5
```

### Output
```
Sum of products of pairs: 70
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following conditions:
- \(N\) must be between 2 and 200,000.
- The number of integers provided must match \(N\).
- Each integer in the list must be between 0 and \(10^9\).

If any of these conditions are violated, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

## Testing

The function has been tested with various input cases, including edge cases and maximum constraints, to ensure correctness and performance.

## Conclusion

The Sum Pairs Calculator is a straightforward tool for computing the sum of products of pairs from a list of integers. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for both casual users and developers needing quick calculations.
