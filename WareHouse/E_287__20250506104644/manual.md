# LCP Calculator

Calculate the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) among a set of strings.

## Introduction

The LCP Calculator is a simple application designed to compute the longest common prefix between multiple strings. It allows users to input a specified number of strings and returns the maximum length of the common prefix found among all pairs of strings. This tool is particularly useful for applications in text processing, data analysis, and more.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter a positive integer representing the number of strings, followed by the strings themselves.
- **LCP Calculation**: The application computes the longest common prefix for each pair of strings using the `lcp` function.
- **Maximum LCP Retrieval**: The application identifies and returns the maximum LCP value found among all pairs of strings.

## Installation

To run the LCP Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the LCP Calculator code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The LCP Calculator does not have external dependencies, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Strings**: The application will prompt you to enter a positive integer. This integer represents the number of strings you wish to input.

   ```
   Enter the number of strings (positive integer):
   ```

3. **Enter the Strings**: For each string, you will be prompted to enter the string value. Ensure that the string is not empty.

   ```
   Enter string 1:
   Enter string 2:
   ...
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After all strings have been entered, the application will compute and display the maximum LCP value.

   ```
   Maximum LCP: <max_lcp_value>
   ```

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of strings (positive integer): 3
Enter string 1: apple
Enter string 2: application
Enter string 3: app
Maximum LCP: 3
```

## Edge Cases

- The application handles empty strings by prompting the user to enter a valid string.
- It also ensures that the number of strings entered is a positive integer.
