Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of strings. Initialize an empty list 'strings' to store the N strings. For each i from 1 to N, read the string 'S_i' from standard input and append it to the 'strings' list. Define a function 'lcp(x, y)' that computes the longest common prefix (LCP) between two strings x and y. Initialize a variable 'max_lcp' to store the maximum LCP value found, starting from 0. Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs (i, j) where i ≠ j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N) and call 'lcp(strings[i-1], strings[j-1])' to compute the LCP. Update 'max_lcp' with the maximum value returned from the 'lcp' function. After checking all pairs, print the value of 'max_lcp' as the final output. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as strings of varying lengths and characters. Confirm that the output format is a single integer representing the maximum LCP value.
