# Count Occurrences Web Application

A simple web application for counting occurrences of a specific integer in a given sequence based on user-defined queries.

## Main Functions

The application provides the following functionalities:

- **Count Occurrences**: Given a sequence of integers and a set of queries, the application counts how many times a specified integer appears in the subarray defined by each query.

## Quick Install

To run the application, you need to set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Flask**: The application uses Flask as the web framework. Install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The application will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## How to Use the Application

### Sending a Request

The application exposes a single endpoint `/count_occurrences` that accepts POST requests. You can use tools like Postman or cURL to send requests.

### Request Format

The request body should be in JSON format and include the following fields:

- `N`: An integer representing the length of the sequence.
- `A`: An array of integers representing the sequence.
- `Q`: An integer representing the number of queries.
- `queries`: A list of query objects, each containing:
  - `L`: The starting index of the subarray (1-based).
  - `R`: The ending index of the subarray (1-based).
  - `X`: The integer to count in the specified subarray.

### Example Request

Hereâ€™s an example of how to structure your JSON request:

```json
{
  "N": 5,
  "A": [1, 2, 3, 2, 1],
  "Q": 2,
  "queries": [
    {"L": 1, "R": 5, "X": 2},
    {"L": 2, "R": 4, "X": 1}
  ]
}
```

### Example cURL Command

You can send the above request using cURL as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/count_occurrences \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "N": 5,
  "A": [1, 2, 3, 2, 1],
  "Q": 2,
  "queries": [
    {"L": 1, "R": 5, "X": 2},
    {"L": 2, "R": 4, "X": 1}
  ]
}'
```

### Response Format

The response will be a JSON array containing the count of occurrences for each query:

```json
[
  {"count": 2},
  {"count": 1}
]
```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling. If the input is invalid, the application will return an error message with a corresponding HTTP status code. Common errors include:

- Invalid types for `N`, `Q`, `L`, `R`, or `X`.
- Out-of-range values for `L` and `R`.
- Missing required fields in the request.

## Conclusion

This web application provides a straightforward way to count occurrences of integers in a sequence based on user-defined queries. For further enhancements or feature requests, feel free to reach out to the development team.
