Read the integer N and the sequence A of length N from standard input. Read the integer Q, which represents the number of queries. For each query, read the integers L, R, and X. Implement a function 'count_occurrences(A, L, R, X)' that counts how many elements in the subarray A[L-1:R] are equal to X. In 'count_occurrences', iterate through the subarray A[L-1] to A[R-1] and maintain a count of elements equal to X. Store the result of each query in a list. After processing all queries, print the results, each on a new line.\n\nNote: Adjust indices as necessary since the problem uses 1-based indexing while Python uses 0-based indexing.
