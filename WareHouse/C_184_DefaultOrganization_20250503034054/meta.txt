Task:
Read the initial position '(r_1, c_1)' and the target position '(r_2, c_2)' from standard input. Define a function 'min_moves(r1, c1, r2, c2)' to calculate the minimum number of moves required. In 'min_moves', check if the current position '(r1, c1)' is the same as the target position '(r2, c2)'. If they are equal, return 0. Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from the current position:\n   - Use a queue to store positions and the number of moves taken to reach them.\n   - Maintain a set to track visited positions to avoid cycles. For each position '(a, b)' dequeued, generate all possible next positions '(c, d)' based on the movement rules:\n   - Check if 'a + b = c + d'.\n   - Check if 'a - b = c - d'.\n   - Check if '|a - c| + |b - d| â‰¤ 3'. For each valid move, enqueue the new position '(c, d)' along with the incremented move count. If the target position '(r2, c2)' is reached during the BFS, return the number of moves taken. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the target, return an indication that the target is unreachable (though theoretically, it should always be reachable). Print the result of the 'min_moves' function. Ensure that all inputs and outputs are handled as integers, adhering to the constraints provided.
