# Minimum Moves Calculator

A Python application to calculate the minimum number of moves required to reach a target position in a grid from a starting position using specific movement rules.

## Overview

This software implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from a given starting position `(r1, c1)` to a target position `(r2, c2)`. The application reads the positions from standard input and outputs the minimum number of moves required to reach the target.

## Main Functions

- **min_moves(r1, c1, r2, c2)**: This function calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach the target position from the starting position. It uses BFS to explore valid moves based on the following rules:
  - The sum of the coordinates must be equal: `a + b = c + d`.
  - The difference of the coordinates must be equal: `a - b = c - d`.
  - The Manhattan distance must be less than or equal to 3: `|a - c| + |b - d| â‰¤ 3`.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application requires the following Python package:

- `collections`: This is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the starting and target positions in the format `(r, c)`. For example:
   ```
   Enter Start Position (r1, c1): (0, 0)
   Enter Target Position (r2, c2): (3, 3)
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will output the minimum number of moves required to reach the target position. If the target position is unreachable, it will indicate that as well.

   ```
   Minimum Moves: 3
   ```

## Example Usage

```bash
Enter Start Position (r1, c1): (0, 0)
Enter Target Position (r2, c2): (3, 3)
Minimum Moves: 3
```

## Error Handling

- If the input format is incorrect, the application will prompt an error message indicating that valid positions must be entered in the format `(r, c)`.

## Conclusion

This application serves as a useful tool for calculating minimum moves in a grid based on specific movement rules. Feel free to modify and enhance the code as per your requirements.
