# Max Divisor Application

The Max Divisor Application is designed to compute the maximum positive integer that divides every element of a list after performing a series of specified operations. This application allows users to manipulate a list of integers and find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the modified list.

## Main Functions

- **max_divisor(N: int, A: List[int], K: int) -> int**: This function takes three parameters:
  - `N`: The size of the list.
  - `A`: A list of integers.
  - `K`: The number of operations to perform.
  
  The function performs operations on the list `A`, updating its elements based on the specified rules, and returns the maximum divisor of the modified list.

## Installation

To run the Max Divisor Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You will need the following Python packages:
- `math`: This is a built-in library and does not require installation.
- `functools`: This is also a built-in library and does not require installation.

To ensure you have the necessary environment, you can create a virtual environment and install any additional dependencies if needed.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv myenv
# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source myenv/bin/activate
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Input Parameters**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - **N**: The size of the list (must be at least 2).
   - **A**: A list of integers (comma-separated).
   - **K**: The number of operations to perform (must be a non-negative integer).

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter N (size of list): 5
   Enter A (comma-separated integers): 10,20,30,40,50
   Enter K (number of operations): 3
   ```

3. **Output**: After processing the input, the application will display the maximum divisor of the modified list.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Max Divisor: 10
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for invalid inputs. If the inputs do not meet the specified criteria, an error message will be displayed. Possible errors include:
- N must be at least 2.
- K must be a non-negative integer.
- The length of A must be equal to N.
- Not enough total value in A to perform K operations without going negative.

## Conclusion

The Max Divisor Application provides a straightforward way to manipulate a list of integers and compute the maximum divisor after a series of operations. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily run the application and obtain the desired results.
