Task:
Define the function 'max_divisor(N: int, A: List[int], K: int) -> int' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the values of N, A (the list of integers), and K from the input format. Implement a loop to perform the operations up to K times, ensuring that the indices i and j are different. For each operation, update the values of A[i] and A[j] accordingly, ensuring A[i] is incremented by 1 and A[j] is decremented by 1. After performing the operations, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the modified list A. Determine the maximum positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Ensure that the operations do not exceed the bounds of the list A and that A[j] does not become negative. Return the computed maximum divisor as the output of the function. Implement error handling for invalid inputs, such as N being less than 2 or K being negative. Format the output to match the required output format, which is a single integer representing the maximum divisor.
