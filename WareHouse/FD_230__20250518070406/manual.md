# Unique Sums Calculator

A Python application for calculating unique sums from a sequence of integers.

## Overview

The Unique Sums Calculator allows users to input a sequence of integers and computes the number of unique sums that can be generated by summing adjacent elements in the sequence. This application is particularly useful for mathematical analysis and combinatorial problems.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer `N` (the length of the sequence) and a list of integers `A` from standard input.
- **Unique Sums Calculation**: The function `count_sequences(N, A)` computes the unique sums that can be formed by summing adjacent elements in the list `A`.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The function gracefully handles cases where `N` is less than 2 or when all elements in `A` are the same.

## Installation

To run the Unique Sums Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application uses standard Python libraries, so no additional dependencies are required. However, ensure you have the `typing` module available, which is included in Python 3.5 and later.

## Usage

To use the Unique Sums Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Data**: When prompted, enter the length of the sequence `N`, followed by the sequence of integers `A`. For example:

   ```
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```

   Here, `5` is the length of the sequence, and `1 2 3 4 5` are the integers in the sequence.

3. **View the Result**: After entering the data, the application will compute and display the number of unique sums modulo `998244353`.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the application works:

```plaintext
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
15
```

In this example, the unique sums generated from the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` result in a total of `15` unique sums.

## Edge Cases

- If `N` is less than 2, the application will return `1` since the only possible sequence is the original one.
- If all elements in `A` are the same, the application will also return `1` as there is only one unique sum possible.

## Conclusion

The Unique Sums Calculator is a powerful tool for analyzing sequences of integers and understanding the combinations of sums that can be generated. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
