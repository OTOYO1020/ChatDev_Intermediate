Task:
Define the function 'count_sequences(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters, where 'N' is the length of the sequence and 'A' is the list of integers representing the sequence. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the list 'A' from standard input. Check if the length of the sequence 'N' is less than 2; if so, return 1 as the only possible sequence is the original one. Create a set to store unique sums that can be generated from the sequence after performing the allowed operations. Iterate through the sequence 'A' and for each adjacent pair of values, calculate their sum and add it to the set of unique sums. Implement a loop to repeatedly apply the operation of summing adjacent values until no further operations can be performed, updating the set of unique sums each time. Count the number of unique sums stored in the set after all operations have been applied. Return the count of unique sums modulo '998244353'. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when all elements in 'A' are the same or when 'N' is exactly 2. Output the final result from the function 'count_sequences'.
