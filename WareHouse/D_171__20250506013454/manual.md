# Sequence Manipulation Application

This application allows users to manipulate a sequence of integers by replacing specified values and calculating the sum of the modified sequence. It is designed to handle multiple operations efficiently.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads integers N (length of the sequence) and Q (number of operations) from the user, along with the sequence of integers and the operations to perform.
- **Data Processing**: The application replaces occurrences of specified integers in the sequence and computes the sum of the modified sequence after each operation.
- **Output**: The results of the sum after each operation are printed line by line.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: 
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the application files (`main.py`, `data_processor.py`, `input_handler.py`) are located.
   - Execute the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the values for N and Q (space-separated). For example:
     ```
     Enter N and Q (space-separated): 5 3
     ```
   - Next, enter the sequence of integers of length N (space-separated). For example:
     ```
     Enter the sequence of length 5 (space-separated integers): 1 2 3 4 5
     ```
   - Finally, for each operation (Q times), enter the integers B and C (space-separated) to specify which integer to replace and what to replace it with. For example:
     ```
     Enter B and C (space-separated): 2 10
     Enter B and C (space-separated): 3 20
     Enter B and C (space-separated): 1 30
     ```

3. **View Results**:
   - After entering all operations, the application will output the sum of the modified sequence after each operation, each on a new line.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the application works:

```
Enter N and Q (space-separated): 5 3
Enter the sequence of length 5 (space-separated integers): 1 2 3 4 5
Enter B and C (space-separated): 2 10
Enter B and C (space-separated): 3 20
Enter B and C (space-separated): 1 30
```

**Output**:
```
Sum after operation 1: 1 + 10 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 23
Sum after operation 2: 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 5 = 40
Sum after operation 3: 30 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 5 = 69
```

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to manipulate sequences of integers through user-defined operations. For any issues or feedback, please contact the support team.
