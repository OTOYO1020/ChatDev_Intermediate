Read integers N and Q from standard input. Read the sequence A of length N from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'results' to store the sum after each operation. For each operation i from 1 to Q:\n   - Read integers B_i and C_i from standard input.\n   - Replace every occurrence of B_i in A with C_i.\n   - Calculate the sum S_i of the modified sequence A.\n   - Append S_i to the 'results' list. Print each value in 'results' on a new line.
