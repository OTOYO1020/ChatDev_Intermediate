Define a function 'count_integers_without_7(N: int) -> int' that takes an integer N as input. Implement a loop to iterate through all integers from 1 to N (inclusive). For each integer in the loop, convert the integer to its decimal representation and check if it contains the digit '7'. If the decimal representation does not contain '7', convert the integer to its octal representation and check if it contains the digit '7'. If both representations do not contain '7', increment a counter variable to keep track of valid integers. Return the counter variable as the output of the function 'count_integers_without_7'. In the main execution block, read the input value for N from standard input. Call the function 'count_integers_without_7' with the input value N. Print the result returned by the function to standard output. Ensure that the program handles the input constraints correctly, specifically 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000.
