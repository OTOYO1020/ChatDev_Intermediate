Task:
Define the function 'count_valid_strings(K: int, C: List[int]) -> int' to handle the main logic of counting valid strings. Parse the input to extract the integer K and the list of integers C, ensuring that K is within the range [1, 1000] and each C[i] is within the range [0, 1000]. Implement a loop to iterate through each uppercase English letter (from A to Z) and check the constraints on occurrences based on the values in C. For each letter, calculate the number of valid occurrences that can be used in the strings, considering the limits set by C. Use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the total number of valid strings for lengths from 1 to K, taking into account the constraints on each letter. Apply modular arithmetic with the modulus 998244353 to ensure that the results do not exceed the limit during calculations. Sum the counts of valid strings for all lengths from 1 to K to get the final result. Return the final count of valid strings as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when all C[i] are zero, resulting in only empty strings being valid. Output the result in the format specified, which is an integer representing the number of valid strings modulo 998244353.
