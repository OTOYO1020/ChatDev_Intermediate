# Happiness Calculation Application

This application calculates the maximum happiness based on altitude differences between connected spaces using a graph representation of slopes.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - Reads the number of spaces (N) and slopes (M).
   - Reads the altitudes of each space into an array.
   - Reads pairs of integers representing bidirectional slopes between spaces.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Initializes a graph using an adjacency list to represent the slopes between spaces.

3. **Happiness Calculation**:
   - Implements a function to calculate happiness based on altitude differences.
   - Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths starting from Space 1 and tracks the maximum happiness encountered.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the maximum happiness value found during the exploration.

## Installation

To run this application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Simply ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository containing the application files (`main.py`, `graph.py`, `happiness.py`) to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**:
   When prompted, enter the following:
   - The number of spaces (N).
   - The number of slopes (M).
   - The altitudes of each space as space-separated integers.
   - The slopes as pairs of integers (U, V) representing the connections between spaces.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter number of spaces (N): 5
   Enter number of slopes (M): 4
   Enter altitudes (space-separated): 10 20 15 25 30
   Enter slopes (U V space-separated, pairs of integers): 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5
   ```

4. **View Output**:
   After entering the data, the application will calculate and display the maximum happiness based on the provided altitudes and slopes.

   Example output:
   ```
   Maximum Happiness: 20
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure:
- The number of altitudes matches the number of spaces.
- All altitude values are integers.
- Slope pairs are valid and unique.
- Slope connections do not connect a space to itself.

If any input is invalid, an error message will be displayed, and the application will terminate.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to calculate the maximum happiness based on altitude differences in a connected graph of spaces. Feel free to modify and enhance the code to suit your specific needs.
