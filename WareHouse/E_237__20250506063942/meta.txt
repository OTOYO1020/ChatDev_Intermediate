Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of spaces and slopes, respectively. Read the altitudes H of each space into an array 'H' of size N. Initialize a graph representation using an adjacency list to store the slopes, where each entry corresponds to a space and contains a list of connected spaces. Read M pairs of integers (U_i, V_i) and populate the adjacency list to represent the bidirectional slopes between spaces. Implement a function 'calculate_happiness(current_space, happiness)' to evaluate the happiness based on the altitude differences when moving between spaces. Use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths starting from Space 1, keeping track of the maximum happiness encountered. For each slope traversed, call 'calculate_happiness' to update the happiness based on the altitudes of the spaces connected by the slope. Maintain a variable 'max_happiness' to store the highest happiness value found during the exploration. After exploring all paths, print the value of 'max_happiness' as the final output. Ensure that the implementation handles the constraints efficiently, considering the maximum values for N and M.
