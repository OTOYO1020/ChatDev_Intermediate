Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of children. Read the array A of length N, which contains the activeness values of each child. Initialize a variable 'max_happiness' to store the maximum total happiness points. Generate all possible permutations of the array A to explore different arrangements of children. For each permutation, calculate the total happiness points:\n   - Initialize a variable 'current_happiness' to 0.\n   - For each child in the permutation, compute the happiness points earned by moving from the original position to the new position using the formula 'A[x] * |x - y|', where x is the original index and y is the new index.\n   - Accumulate the happiness points in 'current_happiness'. Compare 'current_happiness' with 'max_happiness' and update 'max_happiness' if 'current_happiness' is greater. After evaluating all permutations, print the value of 'max_happiness'.\n\nNote: Since generating all permutations can be computationally expensive, consider optimizing the approach if necessary.
