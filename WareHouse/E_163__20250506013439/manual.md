# Happiness Points Calculator

A software tool designed to calculate the maximum happiness points based on children's activeness values through various permutations of their arrangements.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment for the Happiness Points Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can directly run the application as it does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library.*

## ü§î What is this?

The Happiness Points Calculator allows users to input the number of children and their respective activeness values. The software then calculates the maximum happiness points based on different arrangements of the children. The happiness points are calculated using the formula:

```
Happiness Points = A[x] * |x - y|
```

Where:
- `A[x]` is the activeness value of the child at original index `x`.
- `|x - y|` is the absolute difference between the original index `x` and the new index `y`.

## üìñ Main Functions

### 1. Input Data

- **Number of Children**: The user is prompted to enter the number of children.
- **Activeness Values**: The user must input the activeness values as a comma-separated list.

### 2. Calculate Maximum Happiness Points

The software generates all possible permutations of the activeness values and calculates the total happiness points for each arrangement. It keeps track of the maximum happiness points encountered during the calculations.

### 3. Output Result

After evaluating all permutations, the software prints the maximum happiness points.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Children**: When prompted, enter the total number of children (an integer).

3. **Input Activeness Values**: Enter the activeness values in a comma-separated format. For example:
   ```
   5
   10,20,30,40,50
   ```

4. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and display the maximum happiness points based on the provided inputs.

## üìÑ Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter number of children: 5
Enter activeness values (comma separated): 10,20,30,40,50
Max Happiness Points: 300
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

If the input values do not match the expected format or if there is a mismatch in the number of children and activeness values, the application will display an error message indicating the issue.

## üìö Further Information

For more details on the implementation, please refer to the source code in `main.py` and `happiness_calculator.py`.
