Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the sequence. Read the sequence of integers A from standard input, which consists of N elements. Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to keep track of the number of valid subsequences. Create a list 'sorted_A' that contains the elements of A sorted in non-decreasing order. For each element 'A'_k' in 'sorted_A' (starting from the second element):\n   - Use binary search to find the number of valid 'A'_1' elements in 'sorted_A' that are less than or equal to 'A'_k'.\n   - Calculate the number of valid subsequences that can be formed with 'A'_k' as the last element using the count of valid 'A'_1' elements. Update 'count' by adding the number of valid subsequences found in the previous step. Since the count can be enormous, take 'count' modulo '998244353'. Print the final value of 'count' as the output.
