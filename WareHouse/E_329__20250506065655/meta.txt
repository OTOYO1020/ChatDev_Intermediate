Task:
Read the lengths N and M, and the strings S and T from standard input. Initialize a string X of length N filled with the character '#'. Create a function 'can_match(X, S, T, N, M)' to determine if X can be transformed to match S. In 'can_match', loop through all possible starting indices from 0 to N-M:\n   - For each index, replace the M consecutive characters in X with T.\n   - Check if the modified X matches S. If any modified version of X matches S, return True; otherwise, return False. Call the 'can_match' function with the initialized values. Print YES if the function returns True, otherwise print NO.
