# String Matching Utility

A Python application for determining if a string can be transformed to match another string by replacing a segment with a specified substring.

## Overview

This software allows users to input two strings and their lengths, and checks if a string initialized with a specific character can be modified to match one of the input strings by replacing a segment with another input string.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads lengths and strings from standard input.
- **String Initialization**: Initializes a string filled with the character `#`.
- **String Matching**: Contains a function `can_match` that checks if the initialized string can be transformed to match the target string.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries, but you may want to create a virtual environment for better dependency management. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Since there are no specific packages required for this application, you can skip this step. However, if you plan to extend functionality in the future, you can create a `requirements.txt` file and add dependencies as needed.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**:
   The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - Length of string `N`
   - Length of string `M`
   - String `S` (the target string)
   - String `T` (the substring to replace)

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter length N: 10
   Enter length M: 3
   Enter string S: abcdefghij
   Enter string T: xyz
   ```

3. **Output**:
   After processing the input, the application will print `YES` if the initialized string can be transformed to match `S`, or `NO` if it cannot.

## Example

For the input:
```
Enter length N: 10
Enter length M: 3
Enter string S: abcdefghij
Enter string T: xyz
```
The output will be:
```
NO
```

## Conclusion

This utility provides a straightforward way to determine if one string can be transformed into another by replacing a segment with a specified substring. It can be further enhanced with additional features or integrated into larger applications as needed.
