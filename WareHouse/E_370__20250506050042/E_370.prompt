Read the integer N and the integer K from standard input. Read the sequence A of length N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'count_valid_divisions' to 0 to keep track of valid divisions. Generate all possible ways to divide the sequence A into contiguous subsequences using a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of indices (i_1, i_2, ..., i_k). For each division, check if any subsequence sums to K:\n   - Initialize a variable 'current_sum' to 0.\n   - For each subsequence defined by the indices, compute the sum of its elements.\n   - If any subsequence's sum equals K, mark the division as invalid. If a division is valid (no subsequence sums to K), increment 'count_valid_divisions'. Since the number of divisions can be large, take the result modulo 998244353. Print the final value of 'count_valid_divisions'.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function: 'count_divisions(A: List[int], K: int) -> int'\n- Variables: 'N', 'K', 'A', 'count_valid_divisions', 'current_sum'\n\n### Input Format:\n- The input will be handled by reading from standard input, where the first line contains N and K, and the second line contains the sequence A.\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output will be a single integer representing the count of valid divisions modulo 998244353.
