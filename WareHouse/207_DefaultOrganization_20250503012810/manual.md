# Ball Operations Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of operations needed to satisfy a specific condition involving red and cyan balls.

## Main Functions

The Ball Operations Calculator performs the following key functions:

1. **Read Input Values**: It reads four integers, A, B, C, and D, from standard input.
2. **Calculate Operations**: It calculates the minimum number of operations required to ensure that the number of cyan balls (A) is less than or equal to the product of the number of red balls (R) and D.
3. **Output Result**: It prints the total number of operations performed to achieve the desired condition.

## Installation

To run the Ball Operations Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Currently, there are no additional dependencies required for this application.*

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: The application will prompt you to enter four integers:
   - **A**: Initial number of cyan balls.
   - **B**: Number of cyan balls added in each operation.
   - **C**: Number of red balls added in each operation.
   - **D**: The multiplier for red balls.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter A: 10
   Enter B: 5
   Enter C: 2
   Enter D: 3
   ```

3. **View Output**: After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the total number of operations required to satisfy the condition.

   Example output:
   ```
   Operations: 3
   ```

## Example

Here’s an example of how the application works:

- If you input:
  ```
  Enter A: 10
  Enter B: 5
  Enter C: 2
  Enter D: 3
  ```
- The application will calculate the number of operations needed to ensure that A ≤ D * R and will output the result.

## Conclusion

The Ball Operations Calculator is a straightforward tool designed to help you understand the relationship between the number of red and cyan balls through simple arithmetic operations. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or to explore further enhancements!
