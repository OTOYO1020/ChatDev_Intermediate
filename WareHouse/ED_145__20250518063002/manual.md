# Happiness Calculator

A simple application to calculate the maximum happiness based on eating times and deliciousness values of dishes.

## Overview

The Happiness Calculator allows users to input the number of dishes, their respective eating times, and deliciousness values. The application computes the maximum happiness Takahashi can achieve by strategically selecting dishes within a given time limit.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts users to enter the number of dishes, time limit, eating times, and deliciousness values with enhanced input validation.
- **Happiness Calculation**: The core functionality calculates the maximum happiness by evaluating different combinations of dish selections based on the provided constraints.
- **Output**: Displays the maximum happiness value calculated from the user inputs.

## Installation

To run the Happiness Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   The application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application directly using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Application**:
   Run the `main.py` file. You will be prompted to enter the required inputs.

2. **Input the Number of Dishes (N)**:
   Enter an integer value representing the number of dishes.

3. **Input the Time Limit (T)**:
   Enter an integer value representing the total time available for eating.

4. **Input Eating Times (A)**:
   Enter a list of integers separated by commas, representing the eating times for each dish (e.g., `1,2,3`).

5. **Input Deliciousness Values (B)**:
   Enter a list of integers separated by commas, representing the deliciousness values for each dish (e.g., `10,20,30`).

6. **View the Result**:
   After entering all inputs, the application will calculate and display the maximum happiness achievable.

## Example

```
Enter the number of dishes (N): 3
Enter the time limit (T): 5
Enter the eating times (A) separated by commas (e.g., 1,2,3): 1,2,3
Enter the deliciousness values (B) separated by commas (e.g., 10,20,30): 10,20,30
The maximum happiness is: 30
```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure that:
- The number of dishes matches the lengths of the eating times and deliciousness values.
- All values entered are non-negative integers.
- The time limit is sufficient for at least one dish.

If an error occurs during input, an appropriate message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Happiness Calculator is a straightforward tool for maximizing happiness through strategic dish selection. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for anyone looking to optimize their dining experience.
