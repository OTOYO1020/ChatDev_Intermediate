Task:
Define the function 'max_happiness(N: int, T: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int' to calculate the maximum happiness. Parse the input to extract integers N, T, and the lists A and B, where A contains the eating times and B contains the deliciousness values. Implement a loop to iterate through each dish and calculate the total time taken if Takahashi chooses that dish first. For each dish chosen, calculate the remaining time available for ordering other dishes and determine which dishes can be ordered within that time. Sort the remaining dishes based on their deliciousness in descending order to maximize happiness. Implement a mechanism to track which dishes have already been ordered to avoid duplicates. Calculate the total happiness for each possible first dish choice and keep track of the maximum happiness found. Ensure that the algorithm efficiently handles the constraints of N, T, A_i, and B_i within the given limits. Return the maximum happiness value from the function. Format the output as an integer representing the maximum possible happiness.
