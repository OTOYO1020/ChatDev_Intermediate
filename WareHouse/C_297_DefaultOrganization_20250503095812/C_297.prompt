Read integers H and W from standard input. Initialize a list 'strings' to store H strings of length W. For each string index i from 1 to H:\n   - Read string S_i and append it to 'strings'. Define a function 'maximize_pcs(strings)' that takes the list of strings as an argument. Inside 'maximize_pcs', iterate through each string S_i in 'strings':\n   - For each character index j from 1 to W-1:\n     - Check if characters at positions j and j+1 are both 'T'.\n     - If true, replace S_i[j] with 'P' and S_i[j+1] with 'C'.\n     - Repeat this process until no more replacements can be made in S_i. Return the modified list of strings after all possible replacements. Call 'maximize_pcs(strings)' and store the result. Print each modified string from the result on a new line. Ensure that the output format matches the requirement of printing each resulting string.
