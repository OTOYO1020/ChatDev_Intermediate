# String Transformation Tool

Transforming strings by replacing occurrences of 'TT' with 'PC'.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a specified number of strings and transforms them by replacing every occurrence of the substring 'TT' with 'PC'. The transformation continues until no further replacements can be made. This tool is particularly useful for string manipulation tasks in various applications.

## Main Functions

- **maximize_pcs(strings)**: This function takes a list of strings and processes each string to replace occurrences of 'TT' with 'PC'. It continues to iterate through the string until no more replacements can be made.

## Quick Install

To run this software, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Currently, there are no external dependencies required for this specific implementation.*

## How to Use

1. **Input Format**:
   - The first line of input should contain two integers, H and W, where H is the number of strings and W is the length of each string.
   - The next H lines should contain the strings of length W.

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Save the provided code into a file named `main.py`.
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the application using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Example Input**:
   ```
   3 5
   TTTTT
   TTTAT
   ATTTT
   ```

4. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   PCCPC
   PCAPC
   APTTT
   ```

   In this example, the first string transforms all 'TT' pairs to 'PC', the second string transforms the first two 'TT' pairs, and the third string remains unchanged as there are no 'TT' pairs.

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: The main application file that handles input, processes the strings, and outputs the results.
- **string_input.py**: This module is no longer needed as we are using standard input directly.
- **result_display.py**: This module is no longer needed as we are using standard output directly.

## Conclusion

This tool provides a straightforward way to manipulate strings based on specific rules. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our development team.
