# Snake Number Counting Application

This application is designed to count Snake numbers within a specified range. A Snake number is defined as a number where the most significant digit is greater than or equal to all other digits.

## Main Functions

- **count_snake_numbers(L: int, R: int) -> int**: This function counts the number of Snake numbers between two integers L and R (inclusive).
- **is_snake_number(n: int) -> bool**: This helper function checks if a given integer n is a Snake number.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Handling**: When prompted, enter two integers L and R separated by a space. Ensure that the values meet the constraints of `10 <= L <= R <= 10^18`.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter two integers L and R (10 <= L <= R <= 10^18): 10 100
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will output the count of Snake numbers within the specified range.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Snake Numbers Count: 9
   ```

## Additional Information

- **Snake Number Definition**: A Snake number is a number where the most significant digit is greater than or equal to all other digits. For example, 321, 555, and 1000 are Snake numbers, while 123 and 543 are not.

- **Error Handling**: If the input values do not meet the specified constraints, the application will display an error message:
   ```
   Input Error: Please ensure 10 <= L <= R <= 10^18.
   ```

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple and efficient way to count Snake numbers within a specified range. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
