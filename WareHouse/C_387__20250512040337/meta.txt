Task:
Define a function 'count_snake_numbers(L: int, R: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting Snake numbers between L and R. Implement input handling to read two integers L and R from standard input. Ensure that L and R are within the constraints of 10 <= L <= R <= 10^18. Create a helper function 'is_snake_number(n: int) -> bool' that checks if a given integer n is a Snake number. In 'is_snake_number', convert the integer n to its string representation to easily access its digits. Extract the most significant digit and compare it with all other digits in the number to determine if it is a Snake number. Iterate through all integers from L to R and use 'is_snake_number' to count how many Snake numbers exist. Store the count of Snake numbers in a variable, say 'snake_count'. Return the value of 'snake_count' from the 'count_snake_numbers' function. Print the output in the required format after calling 'count_snake_numbers' with the input values.
