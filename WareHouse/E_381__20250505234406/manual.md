# Subsequence Length Calculator

A Python application for calculating the maximum valid subsequence length from a string based on specified queries.

## Quick Install

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:

```
# Add any required dependencies here
```

## ü§î What is this?

The Subsequence Length Calculator is designed to process a string consisting of characters '1', '2', and '/' and determine the maximum length of valid subsequences based on user-defined queries. The valid subsequences must follow specific rules regarding the counts of '1's, '2's, and the presence of '/'.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application reads integers N (length of the string) and Q (number of queries), followed by the string S and the queries themselves.
2. **Query Processing**: For each query, the application extracts a substring and checks if it meets the criteria for forming a valid subsequence.
3. **Validation**: The application checks for:
   - Odd length of the substring.
   - Sufficient counts of '1's and '2's.
   - Presence of at least one '/'.
4. **Output**: After processing all queries, the application outputs the maximum length of the valid subsequence found.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Input**: Create a text file or prepare to input directly into the terminal. The input format should be as follows:
   ```
   N Q
   S
   L1 R1
   L2 R2
   ...
   LQ RQ
   ```
   Where:
   - `N` is the length of the string `S`.
   - `Q` is the number of queries.
   - `S` is the string consisting of characters '1', '2', and '/'.
   - Each `Li Ri` pair defines the substring to be processed.

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Example**: Here is an example of how to structure your input:
   ```
   10 3
   112/22112
   1 5
   2 8
   3 10
   ```

4. **View Output**: After processing, the application will print the maximum length of the valid subsequence found across all queries. If no valid subsequence exists, it will output `0`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

- The application performs input validation and will notify you if:
  - N or Q are non-positive integers.
  - The length of the string S does not match N.
  - Queries are out of the valid range.
  - The substring length is not odd.
  
Make sure to follow the input format strictly to avoid errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate how to use the application:

1. Input:
   ```
   10 2
   112/22112
   1 6
   3 10
   ```

2. Expected Output:
   ```
   5
   ```

This indicates that the maximum valid subsequence length found across the queries is 5.
