Read the integers N and Q from standard input, followed by the string S of length N consisting of characters '1', '2', and '/'. For each query, read the integers L and R which define the substring T as S[L-1:R] (adjusting for 0-based indexing). Initialize a variable 'max_length' to store the maximum length of a valid 11/22 subsequence found across all queries. For each query, extract the substring T and calculate its length. Check if the length of T is odd; if not, skip to the next query and continue. Count the number of '1's, '2's, and '/' in the substring T. Determine the maximum possible length of a valid 11/22 subsequence based on the counts:\n   - The number of '1's must be at least (length of T - 1) / 2.\n   - The number of '2's must be at least (length of T - 1) / 2.\n   - Ensure there is at least one '/' present. If the conditions are satisfied, calculate the length of the valid subsequence as (number of '1's + number of '2's + 1) and update 'max_length'. After processing all queries, print the maximum length of the valid 11/22 subsequence found. Handle edge cases where no valid subsequence exists by ensuring that the output is '0' if no valid subsequence is found for a query.
