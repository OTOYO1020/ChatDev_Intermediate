# Integer Sequence Generator

A Python application for generating and displaying integer sequences based on user input.

## Overview

This software allows users to input an integer \(N\) within the range of 1 to 30 and generates a list of sequences. Each sequence corresponds to the binomial coefficients, which can be visualized as rows in Pascal's Triangle. The application is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear output formatting.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer \(N\) from standard input and ensures it falls within the specified range.
- **Sequence Generation**: It constructs a list of lists, where each sublist contains the integer sequence corresponding to the binomial coefficients.
- **Output Formatting**: Each sequence is printed on a new line, with elements separated by spaces.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (currently empty for future scalability):
   ```
   # Future dependencies can be added here
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer to use conda:
   ```bash
   conda create --name sequence_generator python=3.8
   conda activate sequence_generator
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input an Integer**:
   When prompted, enter an integer \(N\) within the range of 1 to 30. For example:
   ```
   Please enter an integer N within the range 1 to 30: 5
   ```

3. **View the Output**:
   The application will generate and display the sequences. For \(N = 5\), the output will be:
   ```
   1
   1 1
   1 2 1
   1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1
   ```

## Example Output

For an input of \(N = 4\), the output will be:
```
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
```

## Future Enhancements

This application is designed with scalability in mind. Future enhancements may include:

- Additional mathematical sequences.
- Graphical representation of the sequences.
- Enhanced input validation and error handling.
