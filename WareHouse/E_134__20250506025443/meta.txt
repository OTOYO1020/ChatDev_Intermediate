Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers in the sequence. Read the sequence of integers A from standard input, storing them in an array 'A' of length N. Create a sorted version of the array 'A_sorted' to facilitate the color assignment based on the condition. Initialize a variable 'colors' to 0 to count the number of colors used. Initialize a variable 'last_color' to -1 to track the last color assigned. Loop through each integer in the sorted array 'A_sorted':\n   - If the current integer is greater than the last assigned integer (tracked by 'last_color'), assign a new color and increment 'colors'.\n   - Update 'last_color' to the current integer. After processing all integers, the value in 'colors' will represent the minimum number of colors required. Print the value of 'colors' as the final output.
