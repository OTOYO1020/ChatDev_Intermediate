# Color Assignment Application

This application reads a sequence of integers and determines the minimum number of colors needed based on specified conditions.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer N followed by N integers from standard input.
- **Sorting**: It creates a sorted version of the input integers to facilitate color assignment.
- **Color Assignment Logic**: The application counts the minimum number of colors required based on the condition that each assigned color must correspond to a unique integer greater than the last assigned integer.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of colors used.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Color Assignment Application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have the standard library available (which comes with Python).

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Input Format**: The application expects input in the following format:
   ```
   N A1 A2 A3 ... AN
   ```
   Where:
   - `N` is the number of integers in the sequence.
   - `A1, A2, A3, ..., AN` are the integers themselves.

   For example, to input five integers: `5 1 2 3 4 5`.

3. **Example Command**: You can run the application using the command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Provide Input**: After running the command, you will see a prompt asking for input. Enter your integers as specified above and press Enter.

5. **Output**: The application will process the input and print the minimum number of colors required based on the provided integers.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Please enter the number of integers followed by the integers themselves (e.g., '5 1 2 3 4 5'):
5 1 2 2 3 4
4
```

In this example, the application determines that four colors are needed for the integers provided.

## Error Handling

- If you enter invalid input (non-integer values), the application will notify you with an error message.
- If no integers are provided or if N is zero, the application will inform you that no colors can be assigned.

## Conclusion

This Color Assignment Application is a simple yet effective tool for determining the minimum number of colors required based on a sequence of integers. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our support team.
