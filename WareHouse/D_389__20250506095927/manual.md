# Circle Square Counter

A simple application to calculate the number of squares completely contained within a circle of a given radius.

## Quick Install

To run the Circle Square Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the application without any additional dependencies. Just ensure you have the standard library available, which is included with Python.

## ü§î What is this?

The Circle Square Counter application allows users to input an integer radius \( R \) and calculates how many unit squares are completely contained within a circle of that radius. The application checks the corners of each square to determine if they lie within the circle.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Radius**:
   When prompted, enter a non-negative integer for the radius of the circle. For example:
   ```
   Enter the radius of the circle: 5
   ```

4. **View the Result**:
   The application will calculate and display the number of squares contained within the circle. For example:
   ```
   Number of squares: 60
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure

The application consists of two main files:

- **circle_square_counter.py**: This module contains the `CircleSquareCounter` class responsible for the core logic of counting squares within the circle.
  
- **main.py**: This is the entry point of the application that handles user input and output.

### CircleSquareCounter Class

- **Initialization**: The class takes a radius as input and initializes the count of squares to zero.
- **count_squares() Method**: This method iterates through all integer pairs within the range of the radius, calculates the distances for the corners of each square, and checks if they are within the circle.

### Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as negative integers. If an invalid input is provided, an error message will be displayed.
