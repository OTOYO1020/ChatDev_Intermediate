# Box Item Management System

Efficiently manage the distribution of items across boxes while minimizing movement costs.

## Overview

The Box Item Management System is designed to help users manage items distributed across various boxes. The application reads the number of boxes and items, along with their respective weights, and calculates the minimum cost required to ensure that each box contains exactly one item. This is achieved by moving excess items to empty boxes while keeping track of the total movement cost.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads user input for the number of boxes/items, box numbers, and item weights.
- **Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total minimum cost of moving items to ensure that each box contains exactly one item.
- **Output**: The application outputs the total cost incurred during the moving process.

## Installation

To run the Box Item Management System, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/box-item-management.git
   cd box-item-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   You can install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, ensure you have the following packages:
   - `collections`
   - `heapq`

   These libraries are part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Provide Input**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of boxes and items (N).
   - Enter the box numbers for each item as space-separated integers.
   - Enter the weights of each item as space-separated integers.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of boxes and items: 5
   Enter box numbers (space-separated): 1 1 2 3 3
   Enter item weights (space-separated): 10 20 30 40 50
   ```

3. **View Output**:
   After processing the input, the application will output the total minimum cost required to achieve the desired configuration.

   Example Output:
   ```
   The total minimum cost is: 30
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure that the number of box numbers and item weights matches the number of items (N) you provide.
- The application will warn you if there are items that could not be moved due to insufficient empty boxes.
