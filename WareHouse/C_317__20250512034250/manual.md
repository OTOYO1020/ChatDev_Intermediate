# Max Road Length Calculator

A Python application to calculate the maximum road length between towns based on user-defined roads and connections.

## Overview

The Max Road Length Calculator allows users to input the number of towns and roads, and then calculates the maximum road length that can be traversed based on the connections provided. The application uses a graph representation and implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths.

## Features

- Input the number of towns and roads.
- Define roads with their connections and lengths.
- Calculate the maximum road length that can be traversed.
- User-friendly command-line interface for input.

## Quick Install

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` script from your command line.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Towns**: When prompted, enter the total number of towns (N).

   ```
   Enter number of towns (N): 5
   ```

3. **Input the Number of Roads**: Next, enter the total number of roads (M).

   ```
   Enter number of roads (M): 6
   ```

4. **Define the Roads**: Enter the roads in the format `A B C`, where:
   - `A` is the starting town,
   - `B` is the ending town,
   - `C` is the length of the road between towns A and B.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter roads in format: A B C (enter 'done' when finished):
   0 1 10
   0 2 15
   1 2 5
   1 3 20
   2 3 10
   3 4 25
   done
   ```

5. **View the Result**: After entering the roads, the application will calculate and display the maximum road length.

   ```
   Max Road Length: 55
   ```

## Code Structure

The application consists of three main files:

- **main.py**: The entry point of the application that handles user input and output.
- **graph.py**: Contains the `Graph` class that represents the towns and roads, including methods for adding roads and finding the maximum road length.
- **input_handler.py**: Handles user input for the number of towns, number of roads, and the roads themselves.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input scenarios, such as:

- Invalid road format.
- Number of roads exceeding the maximum possible connections.
- Invalid town numbers.

If an error occurs, a descriptive message will be displayed to guide the user in correcting their input.

## Conclusion

The Max Road Length Calculator is a powerful tool for analyzing road connections between towns. By following the instructions in this manual, users can easily set up and utilize the application to find the maximum road length based on their input.
