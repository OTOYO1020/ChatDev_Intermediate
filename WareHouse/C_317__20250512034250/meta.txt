Task:
Define the function 'max_road_length(N: int, M: int, roads: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int' to encapsulate the solution logic. Parse the input to extract the number of towns 'N' and the number of roads 'M'. Create a list of tuples 'roads' to store the connections and lengths of each road, where each tuple is of the form '(A_i, B_i, C_i)'. Implement a graph representation (e.g., adjacency list) to represent the towns and roads. Implement a depth-first search (DFS) or backtracking algorithm to explore all possible paths starting from each town. Ensure that the algorithm tracks visited towns to avoid revisiting them during the path traversal. Calculate the total length of the roads traversed for each valid path found. Keep track of the maximum total length encountered during the traversal of all paths. Return the maximum total length found as the output of the function. Format the output as an integer representing the maximum road length.
