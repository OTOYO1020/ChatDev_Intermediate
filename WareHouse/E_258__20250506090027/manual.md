# Potato Packing Application

Efficiently pack potatoes into boxes based on their weights and a specified threshold.

## Quick Install

To run the Potato Packing Application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file that includes any necessary libraries.*

## ü§î What is this?

The Potato Packing Application is designed to help users efficiently pack potatoes into boxes based on their weights. The application reads an array of potato weights and a threshold weight, then simulates packing potatoes into boxes without needing to iterate through an impractically large number of potatoes.

### Main Features

- **Input Handling**: Read integers for the number of weights (N) and the number of queries (Q), followed by an array of weights.
- **Packing Logic**: Automatically packs potatoes into boxes based on their weights and a specified threshold.
- **Query Support**: Allows users to query the number of potatoes in any sealed box.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects the following input format:
   - First line: Two integers, N (number of weights) and Q (number of queries).
   - Second line: An array of N integers representing the weights of the potatoes.
   - Third line: An integer X representing the weight threshold for sealing a box.
   - Next Q lines: Each line contains a positive integer \(K_i\) representing the query for the K-th sealed box.

   Example input:
   ```
   5 3
   2 3 5 7 11
   10
   1
   2
   3
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Output**: The application will output the number of potatoes in each queried box. If a queried box does not exist, it will return "Box does not exist."

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure

The application consists of three main files:

- **main.py**: The entry point of the application that handles input and output.
- **potato_box.py**: Contains the logic for packing potatoes into boxes.
- **utils.py**: Provides utility functions for input validation.

### Example Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how the packing logic is implemented in `potato_box.py`:

```python
class PotatoBox:
    def __init__(self, weights, threshold):
        self.weights = weights
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.boxes = []

    def pack_potatoes(self):
        # Logic to pack potatoes based on weights and threshold
        ...
```
