Read integers N and Q from standard input, followed by an array W of length N representing the weights of the potatoes. Initialize an empty list 'boxes' to keep track of the number of potatoes in each sealed box. Initialize a variable 'current_weight' to 0 to track the total weight of potatoes in the current box. Loop through a large number of potatoes (up to \(10^{100}\)):\n   - For each potato, determine its weight using the formula \(W[(i-1) \mod N]\).\n   - Add the weight of the current potato to 'current_weight'.\n   - If 'current_weight' is greater than or equal to X:\n     - Seal the current box by appending the count of potatoes packed into it to 'boxes'.\n     - Reset 'current_weight' to 0 for the next box. After processing the potatoes, read Q queries, each containing a positive integer \(K_i\). For each query \(K_i\), retrieve the number of potatoes in the \(K_i\)-th sealed box from the 'boxes' list. Print the results for each query on a new line.\n\nNote: Since \(K_i\) can be as large as \(10^{12}\), ensure that the implementation can handle the required number of boxes efficiently without simulating all \(10^{100}\) potatoes directly.
