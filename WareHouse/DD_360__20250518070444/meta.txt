Task:
Define the function 'count_passing_pairs(N: int, T: int, S: str, X: List[int]) -> int' to encapsulate the solution. Parse the input values for 'N', 'T', 'S', and 'X' from the input format, ensuring 'S' is a binary string of length 'N' and 'X' is a list of distinct integers. Initialize a list to store the final positions of each ant after time 'T + 0.1' based on their initial positions and directions indicated by 'S'. Calculate the final position of each ant using the formula: 'final_position[i] = X[i] + (1 if S[i] == '1' else -1) * (T + 0.1)'. Sort the list of final positions to facilitate the counting of passing pairs. Iterate through the sorted final positions and count the number of pairs '(i, j)' such that 'final_position[i] < final_position[j]' and 'S[i] == '0'' and 'S[j] == '1''. Ensure that the counting logic correctly identifies pairs that pass each other based on their final positions and initial directions. Return the total count of passing pairs from the function. Implement error handling for invalid input values, ensuring 'N', 'T', and elements of 'X' are within specified constraints. Output the result as an integer representing the number of passing pairs.
