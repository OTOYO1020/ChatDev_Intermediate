Read integers N and M from standard input. Initialize a list 'assignments' to store the pairs of integers assigned to each playing field. Create a list 'players' containing integers from 1 to N to represent the players. For each playing field from 1 to M:\n   - Assign two distinct integers from the 'players' list to the current playing field.\n   - Ensure that the same integer is not assigned to multiple playing fields. Implement a mechanism to rotate the players' integers after each round:\n   - For each player, increment their integer by 1.\n   - If a player's integer exceeds N, reset it to 1. Ensure that no player fights the same opponent more than once during the N rounds:\n   - Track the opponents each player has faced using a data structure (e.g., a set).\n   - Check against this data structure before assigning opponents in each round. Print the 'assignments' list, which contains the pairs of integers assigned to each playing field. Ensure that the output format matches the required specifications (e.g., pairs on separate lines).
