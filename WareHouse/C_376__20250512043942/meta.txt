Task:
Define the function 'min_box_size(N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of toys, A is the list of toy sizes, and B is the list of box sizes. Read the input values for N, A, and B from standard input in the specified format. Sort the list A of toy sizes in non-decreasing order. Sort the list B of box sizes in non-decreasing order. Determine the maximum size of the toys that need to be stored, which is the last element of the sorted list A. Check if the existing boxes in list B can accommodate the toys by iterating through the sorted list A and comparing with the sorted list B. If there are not enough boxes to accommodate all toys, calculate the minimum size x for the new box needed to store the largest toy. Return the minimum size x if it exists, otherwise return -1 to indicate that it is not possible to store all toys. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when all toys are larger than the largest existing box. Output the result in the specified format, which is the minimum box size x or -1 if not possible.
