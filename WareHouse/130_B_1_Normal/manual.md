# Bounce Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of valid bounces based on user-defined inputs.

## Main Functions

The Bounce Calculator provides the following main functions:

1. **Parse Input**: Reads integers `N`, a list of integers `L`, and an integer `X` from user input.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Initializes the bounce coordinates with the starting point (0).
3. **Calculate Bounce Coordinates**: Computes the bounce coordinates based on the number of bounces and the distances provided.
4. **Count Valid Bounces**: Counts how many bounce coordinates are less than or equal to `X`.
5. **Return Result**: Formats and returns the count of valid bounces for output.

## Quick Install

To run the Bounce Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies if there are any additional libraries required.

## How to Use the Bounce Calculator

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - **N**: The number of bounces (an integer).
   - **L**: A list of integers representing the distances of each bounce (comma-separated).
   - **X**: The maximum coordinate (an integer).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter N (number of bounces): 3
   Enter list of integers L (comma-separated): 2,3,5
   Enter X (maximum coordinate): 8
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will calculate and display the number of valid bounces.

   Example output:
   ```
   Number of valid bounces: 3
   ```

4. **Error Handling**: If you enter invalid data (e.g., non-integer values, mismatched lengths), the application will prompt you to try again with an appropriate error message.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to use the Bounce Calculator:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the following when prompted:
   ```
   Enter N (number of bounces): 4
   Enter list of integers L (comma-separated): 1,2,3,4
   Enter X (maximum coordinate): 10
   ```

3. The output will be:
   ```
   Number of valid bounces: 4
   ```

## Conclusion

The Bounce Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating bounce coordinates and counting valid bounces based on user input. For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the code comments or reach out to the development team.
