Task:
Parse Input: Create a function 'parse_input()' to handle the input format. Read integers 'N', a list of integers 'L', and an integer 'X'. / Initialize Variables: Define a function 'initialize_variables()' to initialize 'D[0] = 0'. / Calculate Bounce Coordinates: Implement 'calculate_bounce_coordinates(N, L)' to compute 'D[i] = D[i-1] + L[i-1]'. / Count Valid Bounces: Create 'count_valid_bounces(D, X)' to count how many coordinates are <= X. / Return Result: Define 'get_result()' to return the count of valid bounces. / Output Format: Print the result from 'get_result()'.
