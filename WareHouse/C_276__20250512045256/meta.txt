Task:
Define a function 'find_previous_permutation(N: int, P: List[int], K: int) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters where N is the size of the permutation, P is the permutation list, and K is the index of the permutation. Parse the input to extract integers N, K, and the list P from the input format. Validate the input to ensure that 2 <= N <= 100 and that the elements of P are unique integers within the range 1 to N. Check that the permutation P is not the identity permutation (1, 2, ..., N). Generate all permutations of the list (1, 2, ..., N) and store them in a list. Sort the list of permutations in lexicographical order. Identify the K-th permutation from the sorted list and ensure it matches the input permutation P. Retrieve the (K-1)-th permutation from the sorted list of permutations. Return the (K-1)-th permutation as the output of the function. Format the output as a list of integers representing the (K-1)-th permutation.
