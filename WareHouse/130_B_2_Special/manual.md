# Bounce Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of bounces based on given distances and a maximum coordinate.

## Quick Install

To run the Bounce Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can clone the repository or download the source code. Navigate to the directory containing the code and run the following command to install any required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: As of now, there are no specific dependencies listed, but this command is a placeholder for future requirements.)

## ü§î What is this?

The Bounce Calculator is designed to read a series of bounce distances and determine how many of those bounces occur within a specified maximum coordinate. The main functionalities include:

- **Input Handling:** Read integers for the number of bounces (N) and the maximum coordinate (X), followed by a list of bounce distances (L).
- **Bounce Calculation:** Calculate how many bounces occur at or below the maximum coordinate.
- **Output:** Display the total number of valid bounces.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Run the Application:**
   To start the Bounce Calculator, execute the `main.py` file. You can do this from the command line:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data:**
   The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - **N:** The number of bounces (an integer).
   - **X:** The maximum coordinate (an integer).
   - **L:** A list of bounce distances (comma-separated integers).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter N (number of bounces): 5
   Enter X (max coordinate): 10
   Enter L (bounce distances, comma-separated): 2,3,5,1,4
   ```

3. **View Results:**
   After entering the data, the application will calculate and display the number of bounces that occur at or below the maximum coordinate.

   Example output:
   ```
   Number of bounces: 5
   ```

## üìö Code Structure

The Bounce Calculator consists of two main files:

- **main.py:** The entry point of the application, responsible for reading input and invoking the bounce calculation.
- **bounce_calculator.py:** Contains the `BounceCalculator` class, which implements the logic for calculating the number of valid bounces.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
- Add unit tests to ensure the accuracy of calculations.
- Extend functionality to support different types of bounce calculations.
