Task:
Define the function 'expected_score(N: int) -> float' to calculate the expected score based on the number of turns N. Implement a method to simulate the die throw, which returns a random integer X between 1 and 6 inclusive. Create a loop that iterates from 1 to N to represent each turn of the game. In each iteration, calculate the expected score if the game continues versus if it ends, using the current die throw value X. Store the expected scores for each turn in a list or array to keep track of the maximum expected value. Implement logic to decide whether to continue or end the game based on the expected scores calculated. Ensure that the function handles the edge case where N is 1, returning the expected score directly from the die throw. Test the function with various values of N to ensure it behaves as expected and returns correct results. Document the function and its parameters, explaining the expected output and how the expected score is calculated. Return the final expected score as a float value from the function 'expected_score'.
