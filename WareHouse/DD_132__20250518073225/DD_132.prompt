Define the function 'countArrangements(N: int, K: int) -> List[int]' to compute the number of arrangements of balls. Implement input handling to read integers N and K from standard input. Initialize a list 'ways' of size K to store the number of arrangements for each move count from 1 to K. Calculate the total arrangements of N balls consisting of K blue and N-K red balls using combinatorial methods. Determine the number of ways to arrange the blue balls such that they can be collected in exactly i moves for each i from 1 to K. Use dynamic programming or combinatorial counting to compute the number of arrangements that result in exactly i moves. Ensure that the results are computed modulo 0^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers. Return the list 'ways' containing the number of arrangements for each i from 1 to K. Implement output handling to print the results in the required format. Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness and efficiency.
