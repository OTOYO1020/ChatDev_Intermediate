# Dragon Movement Application

Welcome to the Dragon Movement application! This software allows you to simulate the movement of a dragon represented by multiple parts. You can control the dragon's head and retrieve the positions of its parts through a simple command interface or a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Main Functions

- **Initialize Dragon**: Set up the dragon with a specified number of parts.
- **Move Dragon**: Move the dragon's head in one of four directions: Right (R), Left (L), Up (U), or Down (D).
- **Get Position**: Retrieve and display the coordinates of a specified part of the dragon.
