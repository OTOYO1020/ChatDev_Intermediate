Define the function 'min_square_side(N: int, K: int, points: List[Tuple[int, int]])' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of points, K is the maximum number of operations, and points is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of each point. Parse the input to extract the values of N, K, and the list of points (X_i, Y_i) from the input format. Implement a method to calculate the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the list of points. Determine the total distance required to move all points to the same x-coordinate and the same y-coordinate, considering the allowed operations. Check if the total distance required to align all points in both dimensions is less than or equal to K; if so, return 0 as the minimum side length. If not all points can be aligned, calculate the minimum side length of the square that can encompass all points after performing up to K operations. Implement logic to find the optimal target x and y coordinates that minimize the side length of the square after moving points. Calculate the side length of the square based on the adjusted coordinates of the points after considering the allowed movements. Return the minimum possible value for the length of a side of the square as an integer. Ensure the output format is a single integer representing the minimum side length of the square.
