# Minimum Square Side Length Calculator

A Python application to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can encompass a set of points after performing a limited number of operations.

## Main Functions

The software provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Parsing**: Accepts the number of points, maximum operations, and the coordinates of the points.
- **Distance Calculation**: Computes the total distance required to align all points to a common x and y coordinate.
- **Alignment Check**: Determines if all points can be aligned within the allowed number of operations.
- **Optimal Target Calculation**: Finds the optimal target coordinates (medians) to minimize the square's side length.
- **Square Side Length Calculation**: Returns the minimum possible value for the length of a side of the square as an integer.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, ensure you have the following packages:
   - `typing` (for type hints, if using Python < 3.9)

## Usage

To use the Minimum Square Side Length Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the main application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the required parameters**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of points (N).
   - Enter the maximum number of operations (K).
   - Input the points in the format `x1,y1,x2,y2,...` (comma-separated).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the number of points (N): 5
   Enter the maximum operations (K): 10
   Enter the points (comma-separated x,y): 1,2,3,4,5,6
   ```

3. **View the result**:
   After entering the inputs, the application will calculate and display the minimum side length of the square that can encompass the points after performing the allowed operations.

   Example output:
   ```
   Minimum Side Length: 4
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example to illustrate how to use the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of points (N): 4
   Enter the maximum operations (K): 5
   Enter the points (comma-separated x,y): 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   Minimum Side Length: 2
   ```
