Define the function 'count_sequences(N: int, M: int, K: int, S: int, T: int, X: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract integers N, M, K, S, T, X and the list of edges (U_i, V_i) from the input format. Construct an adjacency list representation of the graph using the edges provided. Implement a dynamic programming approach to count valid sequences A of length K that start at S and end at T. Ensure that the sequence A includes the vertex X an even number of times, using a counter to track occurrences of X. Check for valid transitions between vertices in the sequence based on the adjacency list. Apply modulo operation with 998244353 to handle large numbers during calculations. Return the final count of valid sequences as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when K is 0 or when S equals T. Output the result in the specified format after calling the function.
