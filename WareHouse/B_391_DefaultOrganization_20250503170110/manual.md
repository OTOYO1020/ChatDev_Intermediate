# Grid Matching Application

This application allows users to find the position of a smaller grid (T) within a larger grid (S). It reads the dimensions and values of both grids and checks for a match, returning the top-left position of the match in a 1-based index format.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads dimensions and values for grids S and T from standard input.
- **Grid Matching**: It iterates through all possible positions in grid S to find a match for grid T.
- **Error Handling**: The application gracefully handles input errors, ensuring that the provided dimensions and grid values are valid.

## Installation

To run the Grid Matching Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the application is hosted on a version control system like Git, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external libraries beyond the Python standard library. Ensure you have Python installed, and you are good to go.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file. Run the application using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the dimensions of the grids followed by the grid values. The input format should be as follows:
   - First line: Two integers N (size of grid S) and M (size of grid T), separated by a space.
   - Next N lines: Each line contains N integers representing the rows of grid S.
   - Next M lines: Each line contains M integers representing the rows of grid T.

   **Example Input:**
   ```
   5 3
   1 2 3 4 5
   6 7 8 9 10
   11 12 13 14 15
   16 17 18 19 20
   21 22 23 24 25
   8 9 10
   13 14 15
   18 19 20
   ```

3. **Output**: The application will output the 1-based index of the top-left position (a, b) of grid T within grid S if a match is found. If no match is found, it will print "No match found."

   **Example Output:**
   ```
   2 3
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- Invalid dimensions: Ensure N >= M and both are positive integers.
- Incorrect row lengths: Each row of grid S must have exactly N elements, and each row of grid T must have exactly M elements.

If an error occurs, the application will print an error message indicating the issue.

## Conclusion

This Grid Matching Application is a simple yet effective tool for finding subgrids within larger grids. It is designed to be user-friendly and robust against common input errors. For any further questions or support, please refer to the documentation or contact the support team.
