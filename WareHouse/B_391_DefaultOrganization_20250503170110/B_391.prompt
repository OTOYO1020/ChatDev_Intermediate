Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the dimensions of grids S and T. Read the N x N grid S, storing it as a 2D list or array. Read the M x M grid T, storing it as a 2D list or array. Initialize a loop to iterate over all possible top-left positions (a, b) in grid S where grid T could fit, which ranges from (1, 1) to (N-M+1, N-M+1). For each position (a, b), check if the subgrid of S starting at (a, b) matches grid T:\n   - Loop through each cell (i, j) in grid T.\n   - Compare S[a+i-1][b+j-1] with T[i][j]. If a match is found, store the values of a and b. Since there is exactly one pair (a, b) satisfying the condition, break the loop once found. Print the values of a and b as the output. Ensure that the output format is in the form of two integers separated by a space. Handle any potential input errors gracefully, ensuring that the input adheres to the specified constraints.
