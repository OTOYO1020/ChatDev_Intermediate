# Square Counter

A simple application to count the number of squares that are completely contained within a circle of a given radius.

## Quick Install

To get started with the Square Counter application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install any required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Square Counter application allows users to input a radius \( R \) and calculates how many unit squares can fit entirely within a circle of that radius. Each square is defined by its corners, and the application checks if all corners of the square are within the circle.

### Main Functions

- **count_squares_within_circle(R)**: This function takes an integer \( R \) as an argument and returns the count of unit squares that are completely contained within a circle of radius \( R \).

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
   - Run the application using the command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Radius**:
   - When prompted, enter an integer value for the radius \( R \).
   - The application will then calculate and display the number of squares that fit within the circle.

3. **Output**:
   - The application will output the result in the format: `Number of squares: X`, where \( X \) is the count of squares.

### Example Usage

```bash
Enter radius R: 5
Number of squares: 60
```

## Error Handling

- If a non-integer value is entered, the application will prompt the user to enter a valid integer.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher is recommended). The application does not have any external dependencies beyond the standard library.

## Conclusion

The Square Counter application is a straightforward tool for calculating the number of unit squares within a circle. It can be useful for educational purposes, geometry-related tasks, or simply for fun with mathematical concepts.
