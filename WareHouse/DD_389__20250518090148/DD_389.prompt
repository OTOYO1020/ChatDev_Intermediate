Define a function named count_squares_within_circle that takes an integer R as an argument. Implement a loop to iterate through possible integer pairs (i, j) within a reasonable range based on R. For each pair (i, j), calculate the coordinates of the four corners of the square: (i+0.5, j+0.5), (i+0.5, j-0.5), (i-0.5, j+0.5), and (i-0.5, j-0.5). Calculate the distance from the origin (0, 0) to each of the four corners using the distance formula. Check if all four corners are within the distance R from the origin. If all corners are within the distance R, increment a counter for the number of squares. Determine the range for i and j based on the radius R to optimize the iteration. Return the final count of squares that are completely contained within the circle. Handle the input format to read the integer R from standard input. Output the result as an integer representing the count of squares.
