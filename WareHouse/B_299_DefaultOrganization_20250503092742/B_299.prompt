Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of players. Initialize two lists: 'colors' to store the color of each player's card and 'ranks' to store the rank of each player's card. For each player from 1 to N, read the color 'C_i' and rank 'R_i' of the card played by player 'i' and store them in the 'colors' and 'ranks' lists respectively. Check if any player has played a card with the specified color T:\n   - If yes, find the player with the maximum rank among those who played color T. If no player has played a card with color T, find the color of the card played by player 1 and determine the player with the maximum rank among those who played that color. Store the ID of the winner based on the above conditions. Print the ID number of the winner.\n\n**Function to call:** 'find_winner(N, colors, ranks, T)'\n\n**Input format:** The input will be handled by reading from standard input, where the first line contains the integer N, followed by N lines of pairs of integers representing the color and rank of each player's card.\n\n**Output format:** The output will be a single integer representing the ID number of the winner.
