Task:
Read integers H, W, and T from standard input. Initialize a 2D list 'grid' of size H x W to store the characters representing the grid squares. Populate the 'grid' with characters from standard input, identifying the positions of the start square (S) and goal square (G). Create a list 'candy_positions' to store the coordinates of all candy squares (o) found in the grid. Implement a function 'can_reach_goal(start, goal, T)' that checks if the goal can be reached from the start within T moves, using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) approach. In 'can_reach_goal', ensure that only non-wall squares (., o) are traversed and count the number of candy squares visited during the pathfinding. If the goal is reachable within T moves, return the maximum number of candy squares visited; otherwise, return -1. Call 'can_reach_goal' with the start and goal coordinates and store the result. Print the result: the maximum number of candy squares visited or -1 if the goal is unreachable. Ensure that all edge cases are handled, such as when there are no candy squares or when T is less than the minimum required moves to reach the goal.
