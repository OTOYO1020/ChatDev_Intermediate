## Quick Install

## ü§î What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy board game for two players. Players alternate placing their marks (X or O) on the board, and the goal is to be the first to get five of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Instructions**:
   - Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the board.
   - Enter your move as two integers (row and column) separated by a space.
   - For example, to place your mark in the first row and first column, enter `0 0`.
   - Enter 'exit' to quit the game.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player aligns five marks in a row, a message will display indicating the winner.
   - If the board is full and no player has won, the game will declare a draw.

4. **Resetting the Game**: After a win or a draw, the game will automatically reset, and players can continue playing.

## üìñ Game Features

- **Interactive Console**: The game runs in the console, providing real-time feedback on the game state.
- **Player Switching**: Players alternate turns automatically.
- **Input Validation**: The game checks for valid moves and prompts players to enter valid coordinates if their input is incorrect.
