In the above example, I have added two dependencies: `javax.swing-api` and `commons-lang3`. You can add more dependencies as needed for your project.

To build and manage your project dependencies using Maven, you can run commands like `mvn clean install` or `mvn dependency:tree`.

If you prefer to use Gradle as your build tool, you can create a build.gradle file and specify the dependencies in a similar way.

build.gradle
