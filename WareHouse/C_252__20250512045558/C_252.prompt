Define a function 'minimum_seconds_to_match_reels(N: int, S: List[str]) -> int' to encapsulate the solution logic. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the list of strings S, ensuring S contains exactly N strings of length 10. Create a data structure to store the positions of each character (0-9) for each reel based on the strings S. For each character from '0' to '9', calculate the minimum time t required for all reels to display that character when stopped. For each reel, determine the time t needed to display a specific character using the formula 't = (position - 1) + k*10' for k being a non-negative integer. Keep track of the minimum time across all characters to find the optimal t that allows all reels to show the same character. Implement a loop to iterate through all characters and calculate the required time for each character using the previously defined logic. Return the minimum time found after evaluating all characters as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when N is at its minimum or maximum limits. Output the result in the format of a single integer representing the minimum number of seconds needed.
