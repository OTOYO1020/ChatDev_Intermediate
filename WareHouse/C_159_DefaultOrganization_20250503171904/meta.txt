Task:
Receive the positive integer \( L \) from standard input. Validate that \( L \) is within the range \( 1 \leq L \leq 1000 \). Define a function 'max_volume(L)' to calculate the maximum volume of the rectangular cuboid. In 'max_volume(L)', derive the dimensions \( a, b, c \) of the cuboid such that \( a + b + c = L \). Use the formula for volume \( V = a \times b \times c \) and express \( c \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \): \( c = L - a - b \). Rewrite the volume function as \( V(a, b) = a \times b \times (L - a - b) \). Optimize the volume function by finding the critical points using calculus or numerical methods. Calculate the maximum volume by iterating over possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) within the constraints. Return the maximum volume found. Print the maximum volume as the output.
