# Cuboid Volume Calculator

Calculate the maximum volume of a rectangular cuboid given a positive integer \( L \).

## Overview

The Cuboid Volume Calculator is a simple application that allows users to input a positive integer \( L \) (where \( 1 \leq L \leq 1000 \)) and calculates the maximum volume of a cuboid with dimensions \( a, b, c \) such that \( a + b + c = L \). The application uses an iterative approach to find the optimal dimensions that yield the maximum volume.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input \( L \) is a positive integer within the specified range.
- **Volume Calculation**: Computes the maximum volume of the cuboid based on the provided \( L \).
- **Output**: Displays the maximum volume to the user.

## Installation

To run the Cuboid Volume Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have any external dependencies, but ensure you have Python installed.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the application files are located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Value for \( L \)**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \( L \) within the range of 1 to 1000.

   ```
   Enter a positive integer L (1 <= L <= 1000):
   ```

3. **View the Result**: After entering a valid value, the application will calculate and display the maximum volume of the cuboid.

   ```
   Maximum Volume: <calculated_volume>
   ```

4. **Error Handling**: If you enter an invalid value (not a positive integer or out of range), the application will prompt you to enter a valid value.

   ```
   Please enter a value between 1 and 1000.
   ```

   or

   ```
   Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.
   ```

## Example

- **Input**: `Enter a positive integer L (1 <= L <= 1000): 10`
- **Output**: `Maximum Volume: 24`

## Conclusion

The Cuboid Volume Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating the maximum volume of a cuboid based on user input. It provides a user-friendly interface and ensures that the input is validated before performing calculations. Enjoy using the application to explore different values of \( L \) and their corresponding maximum volumes!
