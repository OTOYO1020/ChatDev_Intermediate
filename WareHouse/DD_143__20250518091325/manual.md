Here's the `manual.md` file for the Triangle Counter application, detailing its main functions, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

# Triangle Counter

A simple application for counting the number of triangles that can be formed from given stick lengths.

## Quick Install

To run the Triangle Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following in your `requirements.txt`:

```
# requirements.txt
# No external dependencies are required for this application
```

## 🤔 What is this?

The Triangle Counter application allows users to input lengths of sticks and calculates how many distinct triangles can be formed using those sticks. The application checks each combination of three sticks to ensure they satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.

## 📦 Main Functions

### 1. `count_triangles(N: int, L: List[int]) -> int`

- **Purpose**: This function counts the number of valid triangles that can be formed from a list of stick lengths.
- **Parameters**:
  - `N` (int): The number of sticks.
  - `L` (List[int]): The list of stick lengths.
- **Returns**: An integer representing the count of valid triangles.

### 2. `main()`

- **Purpose**: The main function that runs the application.
- **Functionality**:
  - Prompts the user to input stick lengths in a comma-separated format.
  - Parses the input and calls the `count_triangles` function to compute the number of triangles.
  - Outputs the result to the user.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Stick Lengths**:
   When prompted, enter the lengths of the sticks separated by commas. For example:

   ```
   Enter stick lengths (comma-separated): 3, 4, 5, 6
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   The application will output the number of triangles that can be formed with the provided stick lengths. For example:

   ```
   Number of triangles: 4
   ```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases

- If you enter fewer than three stick lengths, the application will return `0` as no triangle can be formed.
- Ensure that the input consists of valid integers separated by commas. If the input is invalid, the application will prompt you to enter valid integers.

## 🧪 Testing

The application has been designed to handle various inputs, including edge cases and maximum constraints (up to 2000 sticks). You can test the function with different sets of stick lengths to ensure correctness.
