Task:
Define a function 'count_triangles(N: int, L: List[int]) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting the number of triangles that can be formed from the sticks. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the list of stick lengths L from the input format. Implement a nested loop to iterate through all combinations of three distinct sticks (i, j, k) where 0 <= i < j < k < N. For each combination of sticks, check if they satisfy the triangle inequality conditions: a < b + c, b < c + a, and c < a + b. Count the number of valid combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality conditions. Return the count of valid triangles from the function 'count_triangles'. Handle edge cases where N is less than 3 by returning 0 immediately, as no triangle can be formed. Ensure that the function can handle the maximum constraints efficiently, considering N can be up to 2000. Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness, including edge cases and maximum constraints. Output the result as an integer representing the number of different triangles that can be formed.
