Task:
Define a function named 'minimum_passengers(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' that takes the number of stops 'N' and a list of integers 'A' representing the changes in the number of passengers at each stop. Initialize a variable 'current_passengers' to 0 to keep track of the current number of passengers on the bus. Iterate through the list 'A' using a loop to update 'current_passengers' by adding each value 'A[i]' to it. Keep track of the minimum value of 'current_passengers' during the iteration to determine the lowest number of passengers at any point. After processing all stops, calculate the minimum possible current number of passengers by taking the absolute value of the minimum tracked value if it is negative. Return the result as the minimum possible current number of passengers, ensuring it is a non-negative integer. Handle input by reading integers from standard input and parsing them into the required format for the function. Ensure that the input constraints are respected, specifically that 'N' is within the range and that each 'A[i]' is an integer within the specified bounds. Implement error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or out-of-bounds integers. Output the result of the function in the format of a single integer representing the minimum possible current number of passengers.
