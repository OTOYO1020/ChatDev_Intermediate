# Bus Passenger Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum number of passengers on a bus based on changes at each stop.

## Overview

The Bus Passenger Calculator allows users to input the number of stops and the corresponding changes in passenger numbers at each stop. It calculates the minimum possible number of passengers on the bus at any point during the journey, ensuring that the result is a non-negative integer.

## Main Functions

- **minimum_passengers(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int**: This function takes the number of stops and a list of integers representing changes in the number of passengers at each stop. It returns the minimum possible current number of passengers on the bus.

## Installation

To run the Bus Passenger Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**: Execute the main application file to start the Bus Passenger Calculator.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the number of stops**: When prompted, enter the number of stops (N). Ensure that N is a positive integer and does not exceed 1000.

3. **Input changes in passengers**: Enter the changes in passengers at each stop as a comma-separated list. For example: `10, -5, 3, -2`.

4. **View the result**: The application will output the minimum possible current number of passengers on the bus.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various invalid inputs:

- If the number of stops is not a positive integer or exceeds 1000, an error message will be displayed.
- If the changes in passengers are not valid integers or do not match the number of stops, an error message will be displayed.
- If any change in passengers is outside the range of -100 to 100, an error message will be displayed.

## Future Scalability

To enhance the functionality of the Bus Passenger Calculator, consider the following potential libraries and features:

- **NumPy**: For advanced numerical operations and handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, especially if the application needs to handle more complex data structures in the future.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing passenger trends over time, which could provide additional insights for users.

## Conclusion

The Bus Passenger Calculator is a straightforward tool designed to help users manage and understand passenger dynamics on a bus. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily calculate the minimum number of passengers at any point during their journey.
