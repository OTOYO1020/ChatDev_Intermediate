Define the function 'is_good_set(N: int, a: List[int]) -> List[int]' to check if a good set of choices exists and to return one such set if it does. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the list a of length N, where each element is either 0 or 1. Initialize a list 'choices' of length N with all elements set to 0, representing that no balls are placed initially. Iterate through each integer i from 1 to N, and for each i, check the condition for multiples of i based on the values in a. For each multiple of i, update the 'choices' list to satisfy the condition that the sum of balls in those boxes is congruent to a[i-1] modulo 2. Ensure that the choices made do not violate the conditions for any other integers j that are multiples of the current i. After processing all integers from 1 to N, verify if the constructed 'choices' list meets all the required conditions. If a valid 'choices' list is found, return this list; otherwise, return an indication that no good set exists. Handle edge cases where N is at its minimum or maximum limits, ensuring performance is within acceptable bounds. Output the result in the required format, indicating whether a good set exists and displaying the choices if applicable.
