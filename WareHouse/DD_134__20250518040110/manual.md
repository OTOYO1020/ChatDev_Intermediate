# Good Set Checker

A Python application designed to determine if a good set of choices exists based on user-defined conditions.

## Overview

The Good Set Checker allows users to input a number and a list of binary values (0s and 1s) to check if a valid configuration of choices can be made. The application processes the input and returns a list of choices that satisfy the specified conditions or indicates that no valid set exists.

## Main Functions

- **is_good_set(N: int, a: List[int]) -> List[int]**: This function checks if a good set of choices exists based on the input parameters. It returns a list of choices if valid or `None` if no good set exists.

## Installation

To run the Good Set Checker, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any required packages here
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure you have Python 3.x installed**. You can check your Python version with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## Usage

To use the Good Set Checker, follow these steps:

1. **Run the application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the data**:
   When prompted, enter the integer `N` followed by the list of binary values (0s and 1s) separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter N and the list (0s and 1s) separated by spaces: 5 1 0 1 0 1
   ```

3. **View the results**:
   The application will process the input and display whether a good set exists along with the choices if applicable. For example:
   ```
   Good set exists: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input:
   ```
   Enter N and the list (0s and 1s) separated by spaces: 4 0 1 0 1
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   Good set exists: [0, 1, 0, 1]
   ```

## Edge Cases

- The application handles edge cases where `N` is at its minimum (1) or maximum limits, ensuring performance is within acceptable bounds.
