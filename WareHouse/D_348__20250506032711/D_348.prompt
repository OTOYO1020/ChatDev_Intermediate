Read the dimensions of the grid, H and W, from standard input. Read the grid representation A, which consists of H rows and W columns, and identify the positions of the start point S and the goal point T. Read the number of medicines N and their respective positions (R_i, C_i) and energy values E_i from standard input. Initialize a data structure (e.g., a list or dictionary) to store the positions and energy values of the medicines. Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the grid starting from the position of S. During the search, keep track of the current energy level and the positions of medicines collected. If Takahashi reaches T, check if he has enough energy to reach it; if so, return success. If he runs out of energy, check if there are any medicines in adjacent cells that can be used to replenish energy. Continue the search until either T is reached or all possible paths are exhausted. Print YES if reaching T is possible, otherwise print NO.
