# SumModApp

A Python application for calculating the sum of subarrays modulo a given integer.

## Overview

The `SumModApp` allows users to input a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer for modulus. The application computes the total sum of all possible subarrays and returns the result modulo the specified integer. This is particularly useful for problems in competitive programming and algorithm design where modular arithmetic is required.

## Main Functions

- **calculate_sum_mod(A: List[int], M: int) -> int**: This function takes a list of non-negative integers `A` and a positive integer `M` as input. It calculates the sum of all subarrays of `A` and returns the total sum modulo `M`.

## Installation

To run the `SumModApp`, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SumModApp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies. For this application, you may not need any external libraries, but you can include common libraries as comments for future use:
   ```
   # numpy
   # pandas
   ```

   Install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The application will prompt you to enter the size of the list `N`.
   - Next, input the list `A` as space-separated integers.
   - Finally, input the modulus integer `M`.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter N (size of list): 5
   Enter list A (space-separated): 1 2 3 4 5
   Enter M (modulus): 3
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The application will output the result of the total sum of all subarrays modulo `M`.

   Example output:
   ```
   Result: 10
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to ensure that:
- The values for `N` and `M` are within the specified constraints (1 ≤ N ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 200000).
- The size of the list `A` matches the input value for `N`.

If any input is invalid, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The `SumModApp` is a simple yet effective tool for calculating subarray sums modulo a given integer. It is designed to handle large inputs efficiently and can be easily integrated into larger projects or used for educational purposes in algorithm studies.
