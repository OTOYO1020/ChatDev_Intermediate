Task:
Define a function 'calculate_sum_mod(A: List[int], M: int) -> int' that takes a list of non-negative integers 'A' and a positive integer 'M' as input. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the list 'A' of size 'N' from standard input. Ensure that the input values for 'N' and 'M' are within the specified constraints (1 ≤ N ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 200000). Create a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs of indices '(l, r)' such that '1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N'. For each pair '(l, r)', calculate the sum of the subarray 'A[l-1]' to 'A[r-1]' (adjusting for 0-based indexing). Compute the modulo of the sum with 'M' using the expression 'sum_A % M'. Accumulate the results of the modulo operation for all pairs '(l, r)' into a total sum variable. Return the total sum as the output of the function 'calculate_sum_mod'. Implement output handling to print the result of the function to standard output. Ensure that the function is optimized to handle the upper limits of the input constraints efficiently.
