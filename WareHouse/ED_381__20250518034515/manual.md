# 11/22 Subsequence Query Processor

A Python application designed to process queries on a given string to find the maximum length of valid 11/22 subsequences.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a string and a series of queries. Each query specifies a substring of the original string, and the software calculates the maximum length of a valid subsequence that can be formed using the characters '1', '2', and '/'.

## Main Functions

- **max_11_22_subsequence(S: str, queries: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]**: 
  - Takes a string `S` and a list of queries, where each query is a tuple of integers `(L, R)`.
  - For each query, it extracts the substring `T` from `S` and checks if its length is odd. If not, it returns `0`.
  - Counts the occurrences of '1', '2', and '/' in `T` to determine the maximum length of a valid subsequence.
  - Returns a list of maximum lengths for each query.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`. 

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Input the String**: When prompted, enter the string `S` that you want to process.

```
Enter the string (S): 121/211/2
```

3. **Input the Number of Queries**: Enter the number of queries `Q` you wish to perform.

```
Enter number of queries (Q): 3
```

4. **Input Each Query**: For each query, input the values of `L` and `R` separated by a space. Ensure that `L` and `R` are within the bounds of the string length.

```
Enter query (L R): 1 5
Enter query (L R): 2 6
Enter query (L R): 3 7
```

5. **View Results**: The application will process the queries and print the maximum lengths for each query on a new line.

```

0
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter an invalid query (where `L` is less than 1, `R` is greater than the length of `S`, or `L` is greater than `R`), the application will notify you and prompt for a valid query.

```
Invalid query (L=0, R=5). Please ensure 1 <= L <= R <= 8.
```

## Future Enhancements

If you anticipate using libraries such as `numpy` or `pandas` for future enhancements, you can include them in the `requirements.txt` file.
