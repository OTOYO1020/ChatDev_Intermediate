Define the function 'max_11_22_subsequence(S: str, queries: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input string 'S' and a list of queries, where each query is a tuple of integers '(L, R)'. Implement input handling to read the string 'S' and the number of queries 'Q' from standard input. Parse the queries from the input, ensuring that each query consists of valid integers 'L' and 'R' within the bounds of the string length 'N'. For each query '(L, R)', extract the substring 'T' from 'S' using slicing: 'T = S[L-1:R]' (adjusting for 0-based indexing). Check if the length of 'T' is odd; if not, append '0' to the results list for that query. Count the number of '1's, '/', and '2's in the substring 'T' to determine the potential maximum length of an 11/22 string subsequence. Calculate the maximum length of the valid 11/22 string subsequence based on the counts of '1's, '/', and '2's. Store the result for each query in a results list, ensuring to handle cases where no valid subsequence exists. Return the results list containing the maximum lengths for each query. Implement output handling to print the results for each query on a new line.
