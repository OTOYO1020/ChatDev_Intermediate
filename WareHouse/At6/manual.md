## Additional Information

- The software uses the tkinter library for the GUI implementation. If you encounter any issues with the GUI, make sure you have tkinter installed or try running the software without the GUI by directly calling the logic functions.

- The software follows the logic described in the problem statement to find the number of integers that satisfy the given condition. It updates the sequences A and B by replacing any 0 values with 1.0 and then finds the common ratio between the updated sequences. Finally, it multiplies the subsequence C by the common ratio to make the sequences A and C identical.

- The software prints the number of integers satisfying the condition, as well as the updated sequences A, B, and C in the terminal or command prompt. You can modify the code to store or display the results in a different format if needed.

- If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact our support team at support@chatdev.com.
