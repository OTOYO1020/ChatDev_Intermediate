# Graph Query Application

A Python application for handling graph queries through breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to compute the sum of indices of vertices within a specified distance.

## Main Functions

The application provides the following main functions:

1. **Graph Representation**: Constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph based on the provided edges.
2. **BFS/DFS Implementation**: Implements a breadth-first search (BFS) to find all vertices within a specified distance from a given vertex.
3. **Query Handling**: Processes multiple queries to calculate the sum of indices of vertices found within the specified distance for each query.
4. **Input Parsing**: Parses user input to extract the number of vertices, edges, and queries.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Run the Application

To start the application, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Input Graph Details

When prompted, enter the graph details in the following format:

```
N M
u1 v1
u2 v2
...
uM vM
Q
x1 k1
x2 k2
...
xQ kQ
```

Where:
- `N` is the number of vertices.
- `M` is the number of edges.
- Each line following `M` contains two integers `u` and `v`, representing an edge between vertex `u` and vertex `v`.
- `Q` is the number of queries.
- Each query consists of two integers `x` and `k`, where `x` is the starting vertex and `k` is the distance.

### Example Input

```
5 4
0 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
2
0 1
1 2
```

### Step 3: View Results

After entering the input, the application will process the queries and output the results in the format:

```
Results: [sum1, sum2, ...]
```

Where each `sum` corresponds to the sum of indices of vertices found within the specified distance for each query.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for:
- Invalid input formats.
- Exceeding the maximum allowed number of edges based on the number of vertices.
- Queries with negative distances.

If an error occurs, an appropriate message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

This application provides a robust solution for querying graph structures and calculating sums of vertex indices based on specified distances. For further enhancements or support, please reach out to the development team.
