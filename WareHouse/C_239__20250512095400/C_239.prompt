Define a function 'is_lattice_point_distance_sqrt5(x1: int, y1: int, x2: int, y2: int) -> bool' to check if there exists a lattice point that is at a distance of sqrt(5) from both given points. Calculate the squared distance from a lattice point (x, y) to the first point (x1, y1) using the formula '(x - x1)**2 + (y - y1)**2'. Calculate the squared distance from the same lattice point (x, y) to the second point (x2, y2) using the formula '(x - x2)**2 + (y - y2)**2'. Check if both squared distances calculated in subtask 2 and subtask 3 equal 5. Generate all possible lattice points (x, y) within a reasonable range around (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) based on the distance requirement. Iterate through each generated lattice point and apply the checks from subtasks 2, 3, and 4. Return 'True' if any lattice point satisfies the distance condition, otherwise return 'False'. Handle input by defining a function 'main()' that reads integers x1, y1, x2, y2 from standard input. Call the 'is_lattice_point_distance_sqrt5' function with the input values. Print 'Yes' if the function returns True, otherwise print 'No'.
