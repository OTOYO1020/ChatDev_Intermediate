Task:
Read integers N and Q from standard input, followed by an array A of size N representing the heights of the students. Initialize an empty list 'results' to store the answers for each query. For each query j from 1 to Q, read the integer x_j from standard input. Count the number of students in array A whose height is at least x_j:\n   - Sort the array A in non-decreasing order.\n   - Use binary search to efficiently find the first index where the height is greater than or equal to x_j. Calculate the count of students with height at least x_j as 'N - index' where 'index' is the result of the binary search. Append the count to the 'results' list. After processing all queries, print each value in the 'results' list on a new line.
