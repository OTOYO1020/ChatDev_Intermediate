# Student Height Query Application

This application allows users to query the number of students whose heights are above a specified threshold. It efficiently processes multiple queries using binary search after sorting the heights of the students.

## Main Functions

- **Input Heights**: Users can input the heights of students.
- **Query Heights**: Users can query how many students have heights greater than or equal to a specified value.
- **Efficient Processing**: The application sorts the heights and uses binary search to quickly find the count of students meeting the query criteria.

## Installation

To run the Student Height Query application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Note: In this case, there are no external dependencies required beyond Python itself.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located, and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Students and Queries**: When prompted, enter two integers separated by a space. The first integer (N) is the number of students, and the second integer (Q) is the number of queries you want to make. For example:
   ```
   5 3
   ```

3. **Input Heights**: You will be prompted to enter the heights of the students. Enter N heights separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   150 160 165 170 180
   ```

4. **Input Query Heights**: For each query, you will be prompted to enter a height. Enter the height you want to query. For example:
   ```
   160
   ```

5. **View Results**: After entering all queries, the application will output the number of students whose heights are at least as tall as the queried height, each on a new line.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the application might be used in practice:

```
Enter two integers (N and Q): 5 3
Enter 5 heights separated by spaces: 150 160 165 170 180
Enter the query height: 160
Enter the query height: 170
Enter the query height: 155
```

**Output:**
```
4
3
5
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter an invalid number of heights or queries, the application will prompt you to re-enter the values.
- If you input non-integer values for heights or queries, the application will notify you and allow you to try again.

## Conclusion

The Student Height Query application is a simple yet powerful tool for querying student heights efficiently. By leveraging sorting and binary search, it provides quick responses to multiple queries, making it ideal for educational settings or any scenario where height data needs to be analyzed.
