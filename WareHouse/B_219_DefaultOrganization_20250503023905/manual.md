# String Concatenation Program

A simple application that concatenates strings based on user input.

## Overview

This program allows users to input three strings (`S1`, `S2`, `S3`) and a string (`T`) composed of the characters '1', '2', and '3'. The program will concatenate the corresponding strings based on the characters in `T` and output the final concatenated string.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The program prompts the user to enter three non-empty strings (`S1`, `S2`, `S3`) and a string (`T`) that can only contain the characters '1', '2', and '3'.
- **String Concatenation**: Based on the characters in `T`, the program appends the corresponding strings (`S1`, `S2`, `S3`) to a result list and concatenates them into a single output string.
- **Output**: The final concatenated string is printed to the standard output.

## Installation

To run the program, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This program does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the main application file using Python.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Strings**: Follow the prompts to enter:
   - String `S1`
   - String `S2`
   - String `S3`
   - String `T` (composed of characters '1', '2', and '3')

4. **View Output**: After entering the strings, the program will output the concatenated result based on your input.

## Example

```
Enter string S1: Hello
Enter string S2: World
Enter string S3: !
Enter string T (composed of 1, 2, 3): 123
HelloWorld!
```

## Notes

- Ensure that `S1`, `S2`, and `S3` are not empty.
- The string `T` must only contain the characters '1', '2', and '3'.
- The program will prompt you again if you enter invalid input.
