Task:
Input Handling: Read integers 'N' and 'M' from standard input. / Read a list of 'M' integers representing broken steps into a list 'broken_steps'. / Pass 'N', 'M', and 'broken_steps' to the function 'countWaysToClimb(N, M, broken_steps)'. Initialize Data Structures: In 'countWaysToClimb', initialize a list 'ways' of size 'N+1' with all elements set to 0. This list will store the number of ways to reach each step. / Set 'ways[0] = 1' since there is exactly one way to be on the 0-th step (starting point). Mark Broken Steps: Create a set 'broken_set' from the 'broken_steps' list for O(1) average-time complexity checks. Dynamic Programming Transition: Iterate over each step 'i' from 1 to 'N': If 'i' is in 'broken_set', continue to the next iteration (skip processing for broken steps). /  Otherwise, update 'ways[i]':{If 'i-1' is not broken, add 'ways[i-1]' to 'ways[i]'. / If 'i-2' is not broken and 'i-2 >= 0', add 'ways[i-2]' to 'ways[i]'.} / Take modulo '1,000,000,007' for each update to 'ways[i]'. Output the Result: Print 'ways[N]', which represents the number of ways to reach the N-th step modulo '1,000,000,007'.
