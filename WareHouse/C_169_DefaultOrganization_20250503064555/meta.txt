Task:
Read the integer value of A from standard input. Read the floating-point value of B from standard input, ensuring it has two digits after the decimal point. Convert B to an integer representation by multiplying it by 100 (to handle the two decimal places). Compute the product of A and the integer representation of B. Truncate the fractional part of the product by performing integer division with 100. Store the result of the truncation. Print the final result as an integer.\n\nFunction to handle the computation:\n- Function name: 'compute_truncated_product(A: int, B: float) -> int'\n\nOutput format:\n- The output will be a single integer representing the truncated product of A and B.
