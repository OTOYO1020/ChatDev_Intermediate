# Truncated Product Calculator

A simple application for calculating the truncated product of an integer and a floating-point number with two decimal places.

## Overview

The Truncated Product Calculator allows users to input an integer (A) and a floating-point number (B) with exactly two decimal places. The application computes the product of A and B, truncates the result to an integer, and outputs the final result.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer and a floating-point number from standard input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the floating-point number has exactly two decimal places or is in scientific notation.
- **Computation**: Multiplies the integer by the integer representation of the floating-point number (multiplied by 100) and truncates the result.
- **Output**: Displays the final truncated product as an integer.

## Installation

To run the Truncated Product Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You can install any required dependencies using pip. If there are no additional dependencies, ensure you have Python installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can run the application directly as it does not require any external libraries.

## How to Use

1. **Run the application**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input values**:
   - When prompted, enter an integer value for A.
   - Enter a floating-point number for B, ensuring it has exactly two decimal places (e.g., `12.34` or in scientific notation like `1.234e1`).

3. **View the result**:
   The application will compute the truncated product and print the result as an integer.

## Example Usage

```
Enter an integer (A): 5
Enter a floating-point number (B) with two decimal places or in scientific notation: 12.34
Result: 61
```

In this example, the product of 5 and 1234 (which is 12.34 multiplied by 100) is computed, truncated to 61.

## Error Handling

If the input for B does not meet the specified format (i.e., not having exactly two decimal places), the application will raise an error and prompt the user to enter valid input.

```
Input Error: B must be a floating-point number with exactly two digits after the decimal point or in scientific notation.
```

## Conclusion

The Truncated Product Calculator is a straightforward application designed to perform a specific calculation efficiently. For any further questions or support, please contact the development team.
