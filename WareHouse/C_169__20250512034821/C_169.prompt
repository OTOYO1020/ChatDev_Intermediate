Define a function named 'compute_product' that takes two parameters: 'A' (an integer) and 'B' (a float). Ensure that the input 'A' is within the range of 0 to 10^15 inclusive. Ensure that the input 'B' is a float with a value between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive) and has exactly two decimal places. Calculate the product of 'A' and 'B' and store it in a variable named 'product'. Truncate the 'product' to remove its fractional part, converting it to an integer and storing it in a variable named 'result'. Implement input handling to read values for 'A' and 'B' from standard input. Convert the input values to the appropriate types: 'A' to an integer and 'B' to a float. Call the 'compute_product' function with the converted 'A' and 'B' values. Print the 'result' as the final output. Ensure that the program handles edge cases, such as 'A' being 0 or 'B' being 0.00.
