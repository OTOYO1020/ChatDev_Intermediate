# Product Computation Tool

A simple tool to compute the product of an integer and a float, ensuring that inputs meet specific validation criteria.

## Main Functions

The Product Computation Tool provides the following main functionalities:

- **Compute Product**: Multiplies an integer `A` (ranging from 0 to 10^15) with a float `B` (ranging from 0.00 to 9.99, with exactly two decimal places).
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the inputs for `A` and `B` are valid before performing the computation.
- **Truncation**: The resulting product is truncated to remove any fractional part, returning an integer result.

## Installation

To run the Product Computation Tool, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This tool does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the tool.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the values for `A` and `B`:
   - For `A`, enter an integer between 0 and 10^15.
   - For `B`, enter a float between 0.00 (inclusive) and 10.00 (exclusive) with exactly two decimal places (e.g., 5.25).

4. **View Result**: The tool will compute the product and display the result. If the inputs are invalid, it will prompt you to enter the values again.

### Example Usage

```
Enter integer A (0 to 10^15): 5
Enter float B (0.00 to 9.99): 3.14
Result: 15
```

### Error Handling

The application includes error handling for invalid inputs. If you enter a value that does not meet the criteria, you will receive an error message indicating the issue. For example:
```
Input Error: A must be between 0 and 10^15 inclusive.
```

## Conclusion

The Product Computation Tool is designed to provide a straightforward way to compute the product of an integer and a float while ensuring that the inputs are valid. This tool can be useful in various applications where such calculations are needed.
