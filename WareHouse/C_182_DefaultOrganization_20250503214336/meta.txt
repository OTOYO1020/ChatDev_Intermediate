Task:
Read the positive integer \( N \) from standard input. Convert \( N \) into a string to access its digits and determine the number of digits \( k \). Initialize a variable 'min_erased' to \( k \) (the maximum number of digits that can be erased). Calculate the sum of the digits of \( N \) and determine its remainder when divided by \( 3 \). If the sum of the digits is already a multiple of \( 3 \), set 'min_erased' to \( 0 \) and proceed to output. If not, check the remainders of the digits when divided by \( 3 \):\n   - Count how many digits have a remainder of \( 1 \) and how many have a remainder of \( 2 \). Based on the counts, determine the minimum number of digits to erase:\n   - If there is at least one digit with a remainder of \( 1 \) and the sum has a remainder of \( 1 \), consider erasing one such digit.\n   - If there is at least two digits with a remainder of \( 2 \) and the sum has a remainder of \( 1 \), consider erasing two such digits.\n   - Similarly, check for the case where the sum has a remainder of \( 2 \) using the counts of digits with remainders. Update 'min_erased' based on the minimum digits that need to be erased to achieve a multiple of \( 3 \). If 'min_erased' is still \( k \), it means it's not possible to form a multiple of \( 3 \); otherwise, output the value of 'min_erased'. Print the result indicating whether it is possible to form a multiple of \( 3 \) and the minimum number of digits erased if possible.
