# Digit Erasure Calculator

A utility for determining the minimum number of digits to erase from a positive integer \( N \) to make the sum of its digits a multiple of 3.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads a positive integer \( N \) from standard input.
- **Digit Analysis**: Converts \( N \) into a string to access its digits and calculates the sum of the digits.
- **Erasure Calculation**: Determines the minimum number of digits to erase based on the sum's remainder when divided by 3.
- **Output**: Displays whether it's possible to form a multiple of 3 and the minimum number of digits to erase if possible.

## Installation

To run the Digit Erasure Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This software does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python version 3.6 or higher.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the software files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py`.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input a Positive Integer**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \). The application will validate the input and proceed with the calculations.

4. **View Results**: After processing, the application will display:
   - The minimum number of digits that need to be erased to make the sum of the digits a multiple of 3.
   - A message indicating whether it is possible to achieve this.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter a positive integer N (only positive integers are accepted): 12345
Minimum digits to erase: 1
```

## Error Handling

- If the input is not a positive integer, the application will prompt you to enter a valid positive integer.
- Any unexpected errors will be caught and displayed to guide you in providing a valid input.

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: The main application file that handles user input and output.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for calculating the minimum digits to erase.

## Conclusion

The Digit Erasure Calculator is a simple yet effective tool for manipulating integers based on their digit sums. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
