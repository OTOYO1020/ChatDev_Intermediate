Task:
Define the function 'find_shortest_time(H: int, W: int, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int' to handle the input format where 'H' is the number of rows, 'W' is the number of columns, and 'grid' is a 2D list representing the town's layout. Parse the input to extract the values of 'H' and 'W', and construct the 'grid' from the input data. Identify the starting position 'start' (coordinates of 'S') and the goal position 'goal' (coordinates of 'G') within the 'grid'. Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the grid, starting from the 'start' position. In the BFS, track visited squares to avoid cycles and ensure that squares marked with '#' are not entered. Allow teleportation by checking for squares with the same character as the current position when at a square represented as 'a', ..., or 'z'. Count the number of seconds taken to reach each square during the BFS traversal. If the goal position 'goal' is reached, return the time taken; otherwise, continue searching until all possibilities are exhausted. If the BFS completes without reaching 'goal', return '-1' to indicate that the destination is unreachable. Ensure the output format is an integer representing the shortest time or '-1' if unreachable.
