# Height Checker

A simple application to determine if a list of heights can be adjusted to form a non-decreasing sequence.

## Main Functions

The Height Checker application includes the following key functionalities:

- **Input Heights**: Users can input the number of heights and the respective heights themselves.
- **Check Non-Decreasing Condition**: The application checks if the heights can be adjusted to be non-decreasing by allowing an increase of 1 unit to any height.
- **Output Result**: The application outputs "YES" if the heights can be made non-decreasing, otherwise it outputs "NO".

## Quick Install

To run the Height Checker application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Squares**: When prompted, enter the number of heights (N) you wish to check.

   ```
   Enter the number of squares (N): 5
   ```

3. **Input the Heights**: Enter the heights as space-separated integers.

   ```
   Enter the heights (space-separated): 3 2 5 1 4
   ```

4. **View the Result**: The application will process the input and display whether the heights can be made non-decreasing.

   ```
   Result: NO
   ```

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how the application works:

- **Input**: 
  ```
  N = 4
  Heights = [1, 3, 2, 4]
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  Result: YES
  ```

In this case, the second height (2) can be increased by 1 to match the previous height (3), making the sequence non-decreasing.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for input validation. If the number of heights entered does not match the specified N, an error message will be displayed.

```
Input Error: Number of heights does not match N.
```

## Conclusion

The Height Checker application is a straightforward tool for checking the possibility of adjusting a list of heights to form a non-decreasing sequence. It is easy to use and provides immediate feedback based on user input.
