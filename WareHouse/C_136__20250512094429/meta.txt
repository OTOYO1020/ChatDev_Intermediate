Task:
Define a function 'canBeNonDecreasing(N: int, H: List[int]) -> bool' to check if the heights can be made non-decreasing. Read the integer input 'N' which represents the number of squares. Read the list of integers 'H' which represents the heights of the squares. Iterate through the list 'H' from the second element to the last element. For each height 'H[i]', check if it is less than 'H[i-1]'. If 'H[i]' is less than 'H[i-1]', check if 'H[i] + 1' is still less than or equal to 'H[i-1]'. If the condition in subtask 6 fails, return 'False' as it's not possible to make heights non-decreasing. If the loop completes without returning 'False', return 'True' indicating it's possible. Handle edge cases where 'N' is 1, directly returning 'True'. Output the result of the function as 'YES' or 'NO' based on the boolean return value.
