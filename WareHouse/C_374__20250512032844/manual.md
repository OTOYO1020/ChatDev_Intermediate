# Lunch Break Calculator

A tool to calculate the minimum possible value of the maximum number of people taking a lunch break at the same time by dividing departments into two groups.

## Main Functions

The Lunch Break Calculator provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Accepts the number of departments and their respective sizes.
- **Division Logic**: Generates all possible ways to divide departments into two groups (A and B).
- **Calculation**: Computes the total number of people in each group and determines the maximum lunch break size for each division.
- **Optimization**: Tracks the minimum value of the maximum lunch break sizes across all divisions.
- **Error Handling**: Validates input to ensure correct data types and values.

## Installation

To run the Lunch Break Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # List of required libraries
   ```
   Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input the Number of Departments**:
   When prompted, enter the total number of departments (N).

2. **Input the Sizes of Departments**:
   Enter the sizes of the departments as a comma-separated list. For example:
   ```
   10,20,30
   ```

3. **View the Result**:
   The application will calculate and display the minimum maximum lunch break size based on the input provided.

## Example

```plaintext
Number of Departments (N): 3
Sizes of Departments (comma-separated): 10,20,30
Minimum Maximum Lunch Break: 30
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the number of departments does not match the size of the list provided.
- If the number of departments is less than or equal to zero.
- If the list of department sizes is empty.
- If any department size is negative.

## Testing

The function has been tested with various test cases to ensure correctness and performance. You can add your own test cases by modifying the input values in the `main.py` file.

## Conclusion

The Lunch Break Calculator is a simple yet effective tool for managing lunch breaks across departments. By optimizing the division of departments, it helps minimize the maximum number of people taking lunch at the same time, thereby improving overall efficiency.
