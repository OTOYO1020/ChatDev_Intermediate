# Travel Cost Calculator

Calculate the minimum total cost of traveling between cities using coordinates in a 3D space.

## Overview

The Travel Cost Calculator is a Python application designed to compute the minimum travel cost between cities based on their 3D coordinates. The application uses the Manhattan distance formula to determine travel costs and explores all possible routes to find the most cost-effective path.

## Main Functions

- **`minimum_travel_cost(N: int, coordinates: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int`**: This function calculates the minimum total travel cost for visiting all cities starting and ending at City 1.
  
- **`travel_cost(a: Tuple[int, int, int], b: Tuple[int, int, int]) -> int`**: A helper function that computes the travel cost between two cities based on their coordinates using the Manhattan distance formula.

- **`validate_coordinates(coordinates: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> bool`**: Validates the input coordinates to ensure they are unique and within specified bounds.

## Installation

To run the Travel Cost Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:

- `itertools` (part of the standard library, no installation needed)
- `typing` (part of the standard library, no installation needed)

You can install any additional packages using pip if needed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the application files.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located.

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Input Coordinates**: When prompted, enter the city coordinates in the format `(x, y, z)` separated by semicolons. For example:

   ```
   0,0,0; 1,1,1; 2,2,2
   ```

   Ensure that:
   - Each coordinate has exactly three integer values.
   - At least two cities are provided.
   - All coordinates are unique and within the bounds of -1000 to 1000.

5. **View Results**: After entering the coordinates, the application will calculate and display the minimum travel cost.

## Example

To calculate the minimum travel cost for three cities located at coordinates (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2), you would input:

```
0,0,0; 1,1,1; 2,2,2
```

The application will output the minimum travel cost based on the provided coordinates.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the input does not contain at least two cities.
- If any coordinate does not have exactly three values.
- If coordinates are not unique or are out of the specified bounds.

In case of an error, the application will display an appropriate error message.

## Conclusion

The Travel Cost Calculator is a powerful tool for determining the most efficient travel route between cities based on their 3D coordinates. By following the instructions above, users can easily install and utilize the application to meet their travel cost calculation needs.
