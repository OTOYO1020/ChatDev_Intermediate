Task:
Define a function 'minimum_travel_cost(N: int, coordinates: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int' to calculate the minimum total cost of traveling between cities. Parse the input to extract the number of cities 'N' and their coordinates '(X_i, Y_i, Z_i)' into a list of tuples. Implement a helper function 'travel_cost(a: Tuple[int, int, int], b: Tuple[int, int, int]) -> int' to compute the travel cost between two cities based on the given formula. Generate all permutations of the cities (excluding City 1) to explore all possible routes for visiting the cities. For each permutation, calculate the total travel cost starting and ending at City 1 using the 'travel_cost' function. Keep track of the minimum travel cost encountered while evaluating all permutations. Ensure that the function handles edge cases such as the minimum number of cities (N=2) correctly. Implement input validation to ensure that the coordinates are within the specified bounds and that no two cities occupy the same point. Return the minimum travel cost found as the output of the 'minimum_travel_cost' function. Format the output as an integer representing the minimum total travel cost.
