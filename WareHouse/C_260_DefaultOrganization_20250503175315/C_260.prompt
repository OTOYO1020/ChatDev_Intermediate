Read the integer N (level of the red jewel) from standard input. Read the integers X (number of blue jewels obtained from converting a red jewel) and Y (number of blue jewels obtained from converting a blue jewel) from standard input. Initialize a variable 'total_blue_jewels' to 0 to keep track of the total number of blue jewels of level 1. Create a loop to process jewels starting from level N down to level 1:\n   - For each level n (from N down to 2):\n     - Convert the red jewel of level n into a red jewel of level (n-1) and X blue jewels of level n.\n     - Update 'total_blue_jewels' by adding X.\n     - Convert each blue jewel of level n into a red jewel of level (n-1) and Y blue jewels of level (n-1).\n     - Update 'total_blue_jewels' by adding Y times the number of blue jewels of level n. After processing all levels, the total number of blue jewels of level 1 is stored in 'total_blue_jewels'. Print the value of 'total_blue_jewels' as the final output.
