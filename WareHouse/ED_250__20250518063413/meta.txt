Task:
Define a function 'check_equal_sets(A: List[int], B: List[int], queries: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[str]' that takes two integer sequences A and B, and a list of queries as input. Parse the input to read the integer sequences A and B, and the number of queries Q. For each query (x_i, y_i), extract the first x_i terms from A and the first y_i terms from B. Convert the extracted terms from A and B into sets to eliminate duplicates. Compare the two sets obtained from the previous step for equality. Store 'Yes' in the results list if the sets are equal, otherwise store 'No'. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for all Q queries. Return the results list containing 'Yes' or 'No' for each query. Ensure that the function handles the constraints of the problem efficiently, considering the maximum limits for N and Q. Format the output as a list of strings, each representing the result of a query.
