Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of persons and the number of insurance purchases, respectively. Initialize a list 'parents' of size N+1 to store the parent of each person, where 'parents[i] = p_i' for 'i = 2' to 'N'. Read the parent relationships for persons 2 to N and populate the 'parents' list. Initialize a list 'insurance' to store tuples of (x_i, y_i) for each insurance purchase. Read M pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) from standard input and populate the 'insurance' list. Create a set 'covered_people' to track unique persons covered by insurance. For each insurance purchase (x_i, y_i):\n   - Use a loop to traverse the family tree starting from person x_i and moving down y_i generations, adding each covered person to the 'covered_people' set. Count the number of unique persons in the 'covered_people' set. Print the count of covered persons.\n\nOutput format: An integer representing the number of unique persons covered by at least one insurance.
