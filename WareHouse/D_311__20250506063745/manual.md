# Ice Square Exploration Application

Explore the grid of ice squares and discover how many unique squares you can touch!

## Overview

This application allows users to navigate a grid representing ice squares and rocks. The player starts at a specific position and can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) until they hit a rock or the edge of the grid. The goal is to count the number of unique ice squares that can be reached from the starting position.

## Main Functions

- **Grid Initialization**: The application reads the dimensions of the grid and the layout, initializing the grid for exploration.
- **Movement Logic**: The player can move in four directions, and the application checks for reachable ice squares.
- **Exploration**: Starting from a specified position, the application explores all reachable ice squares and counts them.
- **Output**: The application prints the total number of unique ice squares that can be touched.

## Installation

To run the Ice Square Exploration Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application uses the `collections` module, which is part of the Python standard library, so no additional dependencies are required.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Grid Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the dimensions of the grid (N and M) as two integers separated by a space. For example:
   ```
   5 5
   ```

3. **Input the Grid Layout**: Next, input the grid layout as N strings, each of length M. Use `.` to represent ice squares and `#` to represent rocks. For example:
   ```
   .....
   ..#..
   ..#..
   ..#..
   .....
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After entering the grid layout, the application will process the input and print the count of reachable ice squares.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to run the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
5 5
.....
..#..
..#..
..#..
.....
```

**Output:**
```
13
```

This indicates that there are 13 unique ice squares that can be touched starting from the position (2, 2).

## Conclusion

The Ice Square Exploration Application provides an engaging way to explore grid-based navigation and counting. Feel free to modify the grid layout and experiment with different configurations to see how many ice squares you can reach!
