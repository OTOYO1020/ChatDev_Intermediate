To play the Hit and Blow Game, follow these instructions:

1. The game will start by generating a three-digit number with different digits.

2. Enter a three-digit number in the input field provided.

   - The number must have three digits and cannot contain duplicate digits.

   - If an incorrect input is entered, such as a number with duplicate digits or a number with a different number of digits, an error message will be displayed, and you will be asked to enter a valid input.
