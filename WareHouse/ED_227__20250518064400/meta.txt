Task:
Define the function 'count_swaps(S: str, K: int) -> int' to handle the input string 'S' and the integer 'K' representing the maximum number of swaps. Implement input handling to read the string 'S' and the integer 'K' from the user or a file. Validate the length of the string 'S' to ensure it is between 2 and 30 characters. Validate that 'K' is a non-negative integer and does not exceed 10^9. Count the number of occurrences of each character ('K', 'E', 'Y') in the string 'S'. Determine the number of unique permutations of the string 'S' that can be formed with the given character counts. Calculate the maximum number of adjacent swaps possible based on the character counts and the value of 'K'. Implement a method to compute the number of valid strings that can be formed with at most 'K' swaps. Return the computed number of valid strings from the function 'count_swaps'. Output the result in the format of an integer representing the number of valid strings.
