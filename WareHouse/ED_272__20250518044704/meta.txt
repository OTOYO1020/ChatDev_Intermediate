Task:
Define a function 'find_minimum_excluded_integer(N: int, M: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to encapsulate the main logic of the problem. Parse the input to extract integers N and M, and the list A of length N. Implement a loop to perform the operation M times, where for each iteration, the current index i (1 to N) is used to update the elements of A by adding i to A[i-1]. After updating the list A in each iteration, create a set to store the updated values of A for efficient lookup. Implement a function to find the minimum non-negative integer not present in the set created from the updated list A. Ensure that the function handles the edge cases where all integers from 0 to N are present in A. Optimize the solution to handle the upper limits of N and M efficiently, considering the constraints provided. Return the result of the minimum non-negative integer found after M operations. Write test cases to validate the function with various scenarios including edge cases. Format the output to match the expected result as a single integer.
