# Minimum Excluded Integer Finder

This software provides a function to find the minimum non-negative integer that is not present in a given list after a series of updates. It is designed for efficiency and handles various edge cases.

## Main Functions

The core function of this software is `find_minimum_excluded_integer(N: int, M: int, A: List[int]) -> int`. This function performs the following tasks:

1. **Input Parsing**: It takes three parameters:
   - `N`: The length of the list `A`.
   - `M`: The number of iterations to perform.
   - `A`: A list of integers.

2. **List Updates**: For each iteration from 1 to M, it updates each element of `A` by adding its 1-based index to it.

3. **Set Creation**: After each update, it creates a set of the updated values for efficient lookup.

4. **Minimum Excluded Integer Calculation**: It finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set created from the updated list.

5. **Error Handling**: The function checks for valid input, ensuring that the length of `A` matches `N` and that all elements in `A` are non-negative integers.

## Installation

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Here’s how to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you do not have a `requirements.txt`, you can simply run:
   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

## Usage

To use the `find_minimum_excluded_integer` function, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Function**:
   In your Python script, import the function from the logic module:
   ```python
   from logic import find_minimum_excluded_integer
   ```

2. **Call the Function**:
   You can call the function with your desired parameters. For example:
   ```python
   result = find_minimum_excluded_integer(5, 3, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
   print(result)  # Output: 5
   ```

3. **Run Test Cases**:
   You can also run the provided test cases to validate the functionality:
   ```python
   from main import test_find_minimum_excluded_integer
   test_find_minimum_excluded_integer()
   ```

## Example

Here’s an example of how to use the function:

```python
from logic import find_minimum_excluded_integer

# Example usage
N = 5
M = 3
A = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
minimum_excluded = find_minimum_excluded_integer(N, M, A)
print(f"The minimum excluded integer is: {minimum_excluded}")  # Output: 5
```

## Edge Cases

The function handles various edge cases, including:
- An empty list.
- All elements being zero.
- Cases where all integers from 0 to N are present in the list.

## Conclusion

This software provides a robust solution for finding the minimum excluded integer after a series of updates to a list. It is efficient and handles edge cases gracefully. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to our support team.
