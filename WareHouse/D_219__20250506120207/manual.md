# Lunchbox Application

The Lunchbox Application is designed to help users determine the minimum number of lunchboxes needed to meet specific requirements for takoyaki and taiyaki. This application efficiently calculates the required lunchboxes using a dynamic programming approach.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers N (number of lunchboxes), X (minimum takoyaki needed), and Y (minimum taiyaki needed) from standard input.
- **Lunchbox Management**: Allows users to input lunchbox contents (takoyaki and taiyaki) and stores them in a structured format.
- **Minimum Lunchbox Calculation**: Utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to find the minimum number of lunchboxes required to meet or exceed the specified takoyaki and taiyaki requirements.
- **Output**: Displays the minimum number of lunchboxes needed or indicates if it is impossible to meet the requirements.

## Installation

To run the Lunchbox Application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the application is hosted on a version control system like Git, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. You can run the application directly without additional installations.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the values for N, X, and Y. For example:
   ```
   3 5 3
   ```
   This means there are 3 lunchboxes, with a requirement of at least 5 takoyaki and 3 taiyaki.

3. **Enter Lunchbox Contents**: For each lunchbox, input the number of takoyaki and taiyaki. For example:
   ```
   2 1
   3 2
   1 1
   ```
   This means:
   - Lunchbox 1 contains 2 takoyaki and 1 taiyaki.
   - Lunchbox 2 contains 3 takoyaki and 2 taiyaki.
   - Lunchbox 3 contains 1 takoyaki and 1 taiyaki.

4. **View Results**: After entering all lunchboxes, the application will calculate and display the minimum number of lunchboxes needed to meet the requirements. If it's impossible to meet the requirements, it will display "Impossible".

## Edge Cases

- If both X and Y are 0, the application will output `0`, indicating no lunchboxes are needed.
- Ensure that the values for N, X, and Y are within the range of 1 to 300, as specified in the constraints.

## Conclusion

The Lunchbox Application provides a straightforward way to determine the minimum number of lunchboxes needed for specific culinary requirements. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and utilize the application for their needs.
