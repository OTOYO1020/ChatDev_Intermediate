Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers to be multiplied. Read the N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N from standard input into an array 'A'. Initialize a variable 'product' to 1 to hold the cumulative product of the integers. Loop through each integer in the array 'A':\n   - For each integer 'A[i]', check if 'product' multiplied by 'A[i]' exceeds '10^18'.\n     - If it does, print '-1' and terminate the program.\n     - If it does not, update 'product' by multiplying it with 'A[i]'. After the loop, print the final value of 'product' if it did not exceed '10^18'.
