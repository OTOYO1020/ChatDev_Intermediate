# Product Calculator

A simple application to calculate the product of a list of integers while handling potential overflow.

## Main Functions

The Product Calculator application performs the following main functions:

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer `N` from standard input, which represents the number of integers to be multiplied.
- **Product Calculation**: Multiplies the `N` integers and checks for overflow against the limit of `10^18`.
- **Error Handling**: If the product exceeds `10^18`, it returns `-1`. If any integer is `0`, it immediately returns `0`.
- **Output**: Prints the final product or an error message based on the calculations.

## Installation

To run the Product Calculator application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have any external dependencies, but ensure you have a compatible version of Python.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: 
   - First, enter the integer `N`, which indicates how many integers you will input.
   - On the next line, input the `N` integers separated by spaces.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   2 3 4 5 6
   ```

3. **Output**: 
   - The application will print the product of the integers if it does not exceed `10^18`.
   - If the product exceeds `10^18`, it will print `-1`.
   - If any integer is `0`, it will print `0`.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   720
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the number of integers provided does not match `N`, the application will raise a `ValueError` and print an error message.
- If any input is invalid (e.g., non-integer values), it will also raise a `ValueError`.

## Conclusion

The Product Calculator is a straightforward application designed to help users calculate the product of integers while managing overflow conditions. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our support team.
