Define the function 'max_experience(X: int, Y: int, A: int, B: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for calculating the maximum EXP. Implement input handling to read integers X, Y, A, and B from standard input. Initialize a variable 'max_exp' to track the maximum EXP, starting from 0. Create a loop to simulate training at Kakomon Gym, multiplying STR by A and increasing EXP by 1 until STR >= Y. Within the loop, check if the current STR after training at Kakomon Gym is still less than Y before proceeding. Create a nested loop to simulate training at AtCoder Gym, adding B to STR and increasing EXP by 1 until STR >= Y. Within the nested loop, check if the current STR after training at AtCoder Gym is still less than Y before proceeding. Update 'max_exp' with the maximum value of EXP obtained from both training gyms. Ensure to handle edge cases where training at either gym could lead to immediate evolution. Return the value of 'max_exp' as the output of the function.
