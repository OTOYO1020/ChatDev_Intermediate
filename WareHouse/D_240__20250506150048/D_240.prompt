Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of balls. Initialize an empty list 'balls' to keep track of the balls currently in the cylinder. For each ball from 1 to N:\n   - Read the integer 'a_i' from standard input, which represents the value on the i-th ball.\n   - Append 'a_i' to the 'balls' list.\n   - Check for consecutive occurrences of the same integer in 'balls':\n     - If there are 'k' consecutive balls with the same value (where 'k >= 2'), remove these balls from the 'balls' list.\n   - Record the current number of balls in the cylinder after inserting the i-th ball. Print the recorded number of balls after each insertion. \n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently manage the insertion and removal of balls while keeping track of the current count.
