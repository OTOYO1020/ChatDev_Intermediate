# String Manipulation Tool

A simple Python application for manipulating strings by reversing specified substrings.

## Overview

This tool allows users to input a string and specify two indices, L and R. The application extracts the substring from the string that spans from index L-1 to R (inclusive), reverses it, and constructs a new string by concatenating the part of the original string before L, the reversed substring, and the part of the original string after R.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the indices L and R, as well as the string S.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the inputs are valid integers and that they fall within the appropriate range.
- **Substring Manipulation**: Extracts the specified substring, reverses it, and constructs the new string.
- **Output**: Displays the modified string after the specified characters have been reversed.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Prompts**: The application will prompt you to enter:
   - **L**: A positive integer indicating the start index (1-based).
   - **R**: A positive integer indicating the end index (1-based).
   - **S**: The string from which you want to extract and manipulate the substring.

3. **Validation**: The application will validate your inputs. If any input is invalid, it will prompt you to try again.

4. **Output**: Once valid inputs are provided, the application will print the modified string with the specified substring reversed.

## Example Usage

```
Enter L (positive integer): 2
Enter R (positive integer): 5
Enter String S: Hello, World!
Result: HoW ,lle!
```

In this example, the substring from index 2 to 5 ("ello") is reversed to "olle", and the final output is "HoW ,lle!".
