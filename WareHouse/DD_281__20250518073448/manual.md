# Greatest Multiple Application

A Python application designed to find the greatest multiple of a given integer from the sums of distinct integers in a provided list.

## Main Functions

The Greatest Multiple Application includes the following main functions:

- **Input Handling**: Reads a list of integers, an integer K, and an integer D from standard input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the input meets specified constraints.
- **Combination Generation**: Generates all possible sums of K distinct integers from the list.
- **Multiple Calculation**: Identifies the greatest multiple of D from the generated sums.
- **Output Handling**: Displays the result or an error message if applicable.

## Installation

To run the Greatest Multiple Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You may need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install itertools
```

This application uses the built-in `itertools` library, which is included in Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required for it.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects three lines of input:
   - The first line should contain a space-separated list of integers (A).
   - The second line should contain the integer K (the number of distinct integers to sum).
   - The third line should contain the integer D (the divisor).

   Example input:
   ```
   1 2 3 4 5
   3
   2
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application from the command line. Ensure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located, then execute:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Handling**: The application will read the input from standard input. You can either type the input directly or redirect it from a file.

4. **View Output**: After processing the input, the application will output the greatest multiple of D found or -1 if no such multiple exists.

## Example Usage

Given the following input:
```
1 2 3 4 5
3
2
```
The application will output:
```
Greatest multiple of 2: 12
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- If the input does not contain exactly three lines.
- If any element in the list A is not a valid integer.
- If any integer in A is out of the specified range (0 to 10^9).
- If K or D does not meet the specified constraints.

In case of an error, the application will print an appropriate error message.

## Conclusion

The Greatest Multiple Application is a powerful tool for calculating the greatest multiple of a specified integer from sums of distinct integers. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily leverage this application for their needs.
