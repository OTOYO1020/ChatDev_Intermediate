# Minimum Operations to Make '1's Contiguous

This software provides a command-line application that calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all '1's in a given binary string contiguous. 

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` and a binary string `S` from standard input.
- **Count '1's**: It counts the number of '1's in the string `S`.
- **Calculate Positions**: It creates a list of indices where '1's are located in the string.
- **Determine Target Positions**: It calculates the target positions for the '1's to be contiguous.
- **Calculate Minimum Operations**: It computes the minimum number of operations (swaps) needed to move the '1's to their target positions.
- **Output**: The program prints the minimum number of operations required.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the code files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies required, you can install them using pip. For this application, no external libraries are needed, but ensure you have Python's standard library.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located and run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the integer `N` (the length of the string) and the binary string `S`. Ensure that the length of `S` matches `N`.

   ```
   Enter integer N: 10
   Enter string S: 1001101001
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the minimum operations required to make all '1's contiguous.

   ```
   Minimum operations: 3
   ```

## Example

For example, if you input `N = 10` and `S = 1001101001`, the program will output:

```
Minimum operations: 3
```

This indicates that a minimum of 3 operations are needed to make all '1's contiguous in the string.

## Conclusion

This application is a simple yet effective tool for calculating the minimum operations to rearrange '1's in a binary string. For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact support.
