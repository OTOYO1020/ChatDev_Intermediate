Define the function signature as 'def max_printable_products(N: int, products: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:' where N is the number of products and products is a list of tuples containing (T_i, D_i). Parse the input to extract the number of products N and their respective timing tuples (T_i, D_i) from the input format. Sort the products based on their entry time T_i to facilitate optimal printing order. Initialize a variable to keep track of the last printed time, starting from a negative value to allow the first print. Iterate through the sorted list of products and for each product, check if it can be printed based on the last printed time and the current product's timing. If a product can be printed, increment the count of printed products and update the last printed time to either T_i or D_i depending on when the print occurs. Ensure to account for the 1 microsecond charge time after each print when determining the next possible print time. Return the total count of products that can be printed as the output of the function. Handle edge cases where N is 0 or where all products have overlapping timings that prevent printing. Output the result in the required format, which is an integer representing the maximum number of products printed.
