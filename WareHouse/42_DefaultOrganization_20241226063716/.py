# The code provided is missing the necessary import statements for the required classes. This will result in compilation errors when trying to use classes such as `JFrame`, `JButton`, `JLabel`, etc.
# To fix this issue, you need to add the necessary import statements at the beginning of the `GUI.java` file. Here is an example of the required import statements:
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
# Please add these import statements to the `GUI.java` file to resolve the compilation errors.
