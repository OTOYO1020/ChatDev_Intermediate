Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers in the sequence. Read the sequence of N positive integers into an array 'a'. Initialize a data structure (e.g., a set) called 'unique_integers' to store distinct integers from the array. Iterate through each integer in the array 'a':\n   - For each integer 'a[i]', add it to the 'unique_integers' set. Determine the count of unique integers by calculating the length of the 'unique_integers' set. Store the count in a variable called 'count_unique'. Print the value of 'count_unique' as the final output.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of distinct integers in the given sequence while adhering to the constraints provided.
