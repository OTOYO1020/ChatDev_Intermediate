# Unique Integer Counter

A simple application to count the number of unique integers from a user-provided sequence.

## Main Functions

The Unique Integer Counter application allows users to:
- Input the number of integers in a sequence.
- Enter a sequence of positive integers.
- Count and display the number of distinct integers in the provided sequence.

## Quick Install

To run the Unique Integer Counter application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Number of Integers**:
   When prompted, enter the number of integers you want to input. For example:
   ```
   Enter the number of integers in the sequence: 5
   ```

4. **Input the Sequence of Integers**:
   Enter the sequence of positive integers separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter 5 positive integers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 2 1
   ```

5. **View the Result**:
   The application will process your input and display the count of unique integers:
   ```
   Count of unique integers: 3
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling to ensure valid input:
- If the number of integers is not a positive integer, you will be prompted to enter a valid number.
- If the sequence does not contain exactly N positive integers, you will be asked to re-enter the sequence.

## Conclusion

The Unique Integer Counter is a straightforward tool for counting distinct integers in a sequence. It is designed to be user-friendly and robust against invalid inputs. Enjoy using the application!
