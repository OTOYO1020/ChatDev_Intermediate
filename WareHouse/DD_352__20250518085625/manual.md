# Minimum Index Difference Calculator

A Python application designed to calculate the minimum index difference for a given permutation of integers.

## Overview

The Minimum Index Difference Calculator allows users to input a permutation of integers and find the minimum difference between the first and last indices of valid subsequences that can be rearranged to form consecutive integers. This tool is particularly useful for problems involving permutations and index manipulation.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user for input values, including the size of the permutation (N), the length of the index sequence (K), and the permutation itself (P).
- **Index Sequence Generation**: The application generates all possible index sequences of length K from the permutation P.
- **Consecutive Integer Check**: For each valid index sequence, the application checks if the corresponding subsequence can be rearranged to form consecutive integers.
- **Minimum Index Difference Calculation**: The application calculates and returns the minimum difference between the first and last indices of valid subsequences.

## Installation

To run the Minimum Index Difference Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip. 

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If there are no specific dependencies listed, you can run the application directly with Python.

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - **N**: Enter a positive integer representing the size of the permutation.
   - **K**: Enter a positive integer representing the length of the index sequence.
   - **P**: Enter the permutation of integers as a comma-separated list (e.g., `1,2,3,4`).

3. **Output**:
   The application will display the minimum index difference or an error message if no valid good index sequences are found.

## Example

```
Enter N (positive integer): 4
Enter K (positive integer): 2
Enter permutation P (comma-separated): 1,3,2,4
Minimum Index Difference: 1
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input scenarios:
- N and K must be positive integers.
- K cannot be greater than N.
- The length of permutation P must equal N.
- Permutation P must contain unique integers from 1 to N.

## Conclusion

The Minimum Index Difference Calculator is a powerful tool for analyzing permutations and their index properties. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily leverage this application for their computational needs.
