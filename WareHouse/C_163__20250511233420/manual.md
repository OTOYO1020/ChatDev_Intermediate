## ü§î What is Gomoku?

Gomoku is a traditional board game that is played on a 15x15 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get five of their pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

   - Players take turns to make their moves. Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'.
   - Enter your move by specifying the row and column numbers (0-indexed) separated by a space. For example, to place your piece in the first row and first column, you would enter `0 0`.

3. **Winning the Game**: The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player gets five pieces in a row, the game will announce the winner and end.
