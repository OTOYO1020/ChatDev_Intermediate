# Integer Operation Calculator

A simple application to perform operations on two positive integers until they are equal.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## ü§î What is this?

The Integer Operation Calculator is designed to read two positive integers, A and B, from the user and perform a series of operations until both integers are equal. The operations consist of subtracting the smaller integer from the larger one. The application counts the number of operations performed and displays this count to the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Functions

### 1. Input Validation

The application ensures that both inputs are positive integers. If the user inputs invalid data, an error message will be displayed, and the user will be prompted to enter the values again.

### 2. Operation Loop

Once valid integers are provided, the application enters a loop where it performs the following operations:
- If A is greater than B, it updates A to be `A - B`.
- If B is greater than or equal to A, it updates B to be `B - A`.
- The loop continues until A equals B, and the number of operations performed is counted.

### 3. Output

After A equals B, the application prints the total number of operations performed.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Positive Integers**: When prompted, enter two positive integers A and B. Ensure both numbers are greater than zero.

3. **View Results**: After the calculations are complete, the application will display the number of operations performed to make A equal to B.

## Example Usage

```
Enter positive integer A: 15
Enter positive integer B: 10
Number of operations performed: 2
```

In this example, the operations performed would be:
1. A = 15, B = 10 ‚Üí A = 5 (15 - 10)
2. A = 5, B = 10 ‚Üí B = 5 (10 - 5)

Both integers are now equal, and the total operations count is 2.
