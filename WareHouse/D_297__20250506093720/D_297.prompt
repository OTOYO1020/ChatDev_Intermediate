Read positive integers A and B from standard input. Initialize a counter variable 'count' to 0 to track the number of operations performed. Create a loop that continues until A equals B:\n   - Inside the loop, check if A is greater than B:\n     - If true, update A with the value of 'A - B'.\n     - If false, update B with the value of 'B - A'.\n   - Increment the 'count' variable by 1 after each operation. Once A equals B, exit the loop. Print the final value of 'count' as the number of operations performed.
