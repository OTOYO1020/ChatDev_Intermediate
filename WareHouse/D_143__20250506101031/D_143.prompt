Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of sticks. Read the lengths of the N sticks into an array 'L' of size N. Initialize a variable 'triangle_count' to 0 to keep track of the number of valid triangles. Use three nested loops to iterate through all combinations of three distinct sticks (i, j, k) where '0 â‰¤ i < j < k < N'. For each combination of sticks, assign their lengths to variables 'a = L[i]', 'b = L[j]', and 'c = L[k]'. Check if the triangle inequality conditions are satisfied:\n   - If 'a < b + c', 'b < c + a', and 'c < a + b', increment 'triangle_count' by 1. After checking all combinations, print the value of 'triangle_count' as the final output.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible triangles are counted based on the given stick lengths while adhering to the triangle inequality conditions.
