# Triangle Counter Application

The Triangle Counter application is designed to determine the number of valid triangles that can be formed using a given set of stick lengths. This application utilizes the triangle inequality theorem to validate the combinations of stick lengths.

## Main Functions

- **count_triangles(stick_lengths)**: This function takes a list of stick lengths and counts the number of valid triangles that can be formed. It checks all combinations of three distinct sticks and applies the triangle inequality conditions.

- **validate_input_lengths(lengths, expected_count)**: This function validates the user input to ensure that the correct number of positive integer stick lengths is provided.

## Installation

To run the Triangle Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input the Number of Sticks**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of sticks (N). This should be a positive integer.

3. **Input the Lengths of the Sticks**:
   - Enter the lengths of the sticks as space-separated positive integers. Ensure that you provide exactly N lengths.

4. **View the Result**:
   - The application will calculate and display the number of valid triangles that can be formed with the provided stick lengths.

### Example Usage

```
Enter the number of sticks (positive integer): 5
Enter the lengths of the sticks (space-separated positive integers): 3 4 5 6 7
Number of valid triangles: 10
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-positive integer for the number of sticks, the application will prompt you to enter a valid positive integer.
- If the number of lengths provided does not match the expected count, or if any length is not a positive integer, the application will display an error message and prompt for input again.

## Conclusion

The Triangle Counter application is a straightforward tool for counting valid triangles based on stick lengths. It is user-friendly and provides clear prompts for input, making it accessible for users of all experience levels.
