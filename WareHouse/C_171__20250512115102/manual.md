# Dog Name Generator

Generate unique dog names based on a base-26-like naming system where 'a' corresponds to 1 and 'z' corresponds to 26.

## Quick Install

To get started with the Dog Name Generator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository and run the application directly.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-name-generator.git
   cd dog-name-generator
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🤔 What is this?

The Dog Name Generator is a Python application that converts an integer input into a corresponding dog name using a base-26-like naming system. This system allows for a wide range of unique names based on the input number.

### Main Features

- **Input Handling**: Accepts an integer input from the user.
- **Base-26 Conversion**: Converts the integer into a string representation using a custom base-26-like system.
- **Range Validation**: Ensures the input number is within the valid range of 1 to 1,000,000,000,000,001.
- **Dynamic Name Generation**: Generates names of varying lengths based on the input number.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, you can run the application using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Number**:
   When prompted, enter an integer value (N) between 1 and 1,000,000,000,000,001. The application will then generate a corresponding dog name.

3. **View the Output**:
   The generated dog name will be displayed in the console.

### Example Usage

```bash
Enter a number: 27
Dog Name: aa
```

In this example, the input `27` corresponds to the dog name `aa`.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

The application is built using Python. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. There are no external libraries required for this application, as it uses built-in Python functionalities.
