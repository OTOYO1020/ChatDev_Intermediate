Define the function 'get_dog_name(N: int) -> str' to retrieve the name of the dog based on its number N. Implement a method to convert the integer N into a base-26-like naming system where 'a' corresponds to 1 and 'z' corresponds to 26. Handle the input format to read an integer N from standard input. Ensure that the function can handle the maximum constraint of N up to 1000000000000001 efficiently. Implement logic to determine the length of the name based on the value of N, considering the ranges defined in the problem statement. Generate the appropriate name for the dog by calculating the corresponding characters based on the base-26-like system. Test the function with various values of N to ensure it returns the correct dog names. Optimize the function for performance to handle large values of N without excessive computation time. Document the function and its parameters for clarity and future reference. Output the name of the dog as a string when the function is called.
