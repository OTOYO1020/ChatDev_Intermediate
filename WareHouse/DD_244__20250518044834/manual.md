# Hat Exchange Application

A simple application to determine if a target configuration of hat colors can be achieved from a current configuration through hat exchanges.

## Main Functions

The Hat Exchange application provides the following main functions:

- **Input Handling**: Reads the current and target hat colors from user input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the input consists only of the colors 'R', 'G', and 'B', and that both lists have the same length.
- **Hat Exchange Logic**: Determines if the target configuration can be achieved from the current configuration by checking if the two lists are permutations of each other.
- **Output Handling**: Prints the result as `True` or `False` based on whether the target configuration can be achieved.

## Installation

To run the Hat Exchange application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application requires no additional dependencies beyond Python's standard library. However, if you wish to use type hinting and annotations, ensure you are using Python 3.5 or higher.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Current and Target Hat Colors**: When prompted, enter the current hat colors (S) and target hat colors (T) separated by commas. For example:
   ```
   Enter current hat colors (S) separated by commas: R,G,B
   Enter target hat colors (T) separated by commas: B,G,R
   ```

4. **View the Result**: The application will output `True` if the target configuration can be achieved, or `False` if it cannot.

## Example Usage

Here are some example inputs and expected outputs:

- Input:
  ```
  Enter current hat colors (S) separated by commas: R,G,B
  Enter target hat colors (T) separated by commas: B,G,R
  ```
  Output: `True`

- Input:
  ```
  Enter current hat colors (S) separated by commas: R,R,G
  Enter target hat colors (T) separated by commas: R,G,B
  ```
  Output: `False`

## Troubleshooting

- **Input Errors**: Ensure that you are only using the colors 'R', 'G', and 'B' and that both lists have the same number of elements.
- **Execution Issues**: Make sure you are using Python 3.5 or higher to avoid compatibility issues with type hints.

## Conclusion

The Hat Exchange application is a straightforward tool for checking if a target configuration of hat colors can be achieved through exchanges. Feel free to modify and extend the application as needed for your use cases.
