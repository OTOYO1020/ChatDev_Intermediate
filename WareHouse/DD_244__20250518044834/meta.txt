Task:
Define a function 'canAchieveTarget(S: List[str], T: List[str]) -> bool' that takes two lists of strings representing the current hat colors and the target hat colors respectively. Implement input handling to read the current hat colors 'S' and target hat colors 'T' from standard input. Ensure that the input 'S' and 'T' are both permutations of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. Determine if it is possible to achieve the target configuration 'T' from the current configuration 'S' after performing the hat exchange operation. Since the operation can be performed an infinite number of times, check if the characters in 'S' can be rearranged to match 'T'. Implement a method to check if two permutations can be transformed into one another through a series of exchanges. Return 'True' if it is possible to achieve the target configuration, otherwise return 'False'. Implement output handling to print 'True' or 'False' based on the result of the function. Test the function with various combinations of 'S' and 'T' to ensure correctness. Document the function and its parameters for clarity.
