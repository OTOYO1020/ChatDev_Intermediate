# Ball Placement Application

This application is designed to solve the problem of placing balls in boxes based on specified parity requirements. The application reads an integer representing the number of boxes and an array that indicates the required parity of the total number of balls in boxes that are multiples of each index.

## Main Functions

- **Calculate Balls**: The core function of the application that determines the placement of balls in boxes based on the given parity requirements.
- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of boxes and the parity requirements from standard input.
- **Output**: Displays the configuration of balls in the boxes or indicates if no valid configuration exists.

## Installation

To run the Ball Placement Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - First, enter an integer `N` which represents the number of boxes.
   - Then, enter `N` integers (either 0 or 1) separated by spaces, representing the required parity for each box.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   0 1 0 1 0
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - The application will print the configuration of balls in the boxes as a space-separated string (e.g., `1 0 1 0 1`).
   - If no valid configuration is possible, it will print `NO`.

## Example

### Input
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```

### Output
```
1 0 1 0 1
```

## Edge Cases

- The application handles edge cases, such as when `N = 1`, ensuring robustness in various scenarios.
- Invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or integers outside the range of 0 and 1) will result in an error message.

## Conclusion

The Ball Placement Application provides a straightforward solution to the problem of placing balls in boxes according to specified parity requirements. With its efficient algorithm, it can handle large values of `N` (up to 200,000) effectively.
