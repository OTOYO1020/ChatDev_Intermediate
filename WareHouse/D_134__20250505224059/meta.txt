Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of boxes. Read the array 'a' of size N, which contains integers (either 0 or 1) that represent the required parity of the total number of balls in boxes with multiples of each index. Initialize an array 'balls' of size N with all elements set to 0, which will represent whether a ball is placed in each box (1 for a ball, 0 for no ball). For each integer 'i' from 1 to N:\n   - Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to count the number of balls in boxes that are multiples of 'i'.\n   - For each multiple 'j' of 'i' (where 'j' ranges from 'i' to 'N' with a step of 'i'):\n     - Increment 'count' by the value of 'balls[j-1]' (since 'balls' is 0-indexed).\n   - Check if 'count % 2' is equal to 'a[i-1]' (the required parity for multiples of 'i').\n     - If not, set 'balls[i-1]' to 1 (place a ball in the 'i'-th box) to adjust the count. After processing all integers from 1 to N, verify if the final configuration of 'balls' satisfies the conditions for all 'i'. If a valid configuration is found, print the array 'balls' as the output. If no valid configuration is possible, print NO to indicate that no good set of choices exists. Ensure that the solution runs efficiently within the constraints, particularly for large values of N (up to 200,000). Handle edge cases, such as when N = 1, to ensure the solution is robust. Output the final result in the specified format (either the configuration of balls or NO).
