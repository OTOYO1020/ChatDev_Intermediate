# Gomoku Game User Manual

Welcome to the Gomoku Game! This manual will guide you through the installation process, main functions of the software, and how to play the game.

## Quick Install

To run the Gomoku game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: If there are no specific dependencies listed, you can skip this step as the game is built using standard Python libraries.)

## ü§î What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a classic board game played on a grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get five of their pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**: 
   - Run the game by executing the `main.py` file. You can do this by navigating to the directory where the file is located and running:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Game Interface**:
   - The game will display a 15x15 board in the console. Each cell is represented by a dot (.) if it is empty, an 'X' for Player 1, and an 'O' for Player 2.

3. **Making a Move**:
   - Players take turns entering their moves. When prompted, enter the row and column numbers separated by a space (e.g., `7 7` to place a piece in the center of the board).
   - The game will validate the move. If the move is invalid (e.g., out of bounds or the cell is already occupied), you will be prompted to try again.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player gets five pieces in a row, the game announces the winner and ends.
   - If the board is full and there is no winner, the game will declare a draw.

5. **Playing Again**:
   - After a game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' to restart the game or 'n' to exit.

## üéÆ Main Functions

- **Game Logic**: The game logic is encapsulated in the `GomokuGame` class found in `game.py`. This class handles the board state, player turns, move validation, win checking, and game resetting.
  
- **Display Board**: The `__str__` method in the `GomokuGame` class provides a string representation of the board, which is printed to the console after each turn.

- **Move Handling**: The `make_move` method processes player moves and checks for wins or draws.

- **Reset Functionality**: The `reset_game` method allows players to start a new game without restarting the application.
