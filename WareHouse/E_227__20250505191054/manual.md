# Unique String Counter

A Python application to calculate the number of unique strings generated by adjacent swaps of characters in a given string.

## Main Functions

The Unique String Counter provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Read a string and the maximum number of adjacent swaps from the user.
- **Unique String Calculation**: Calculate the number of unique strings that can be generated through adjacent swaps.
- **Permutations Calculation**: If the number of swaps is greater than or equal to the length of the string, calculate the number of unique permutations of the string.

## Quick Install

To run the Unique String Counter, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:

   ```

4. **Input the Number of Swaps**: Next, enter the maximum number of adjacent swaps allowed.

   ```
   Enter number of swaps: <number_of_swaps>
   ```

5. **View the Result**: The application will output the count of unique strings generated through the allowed swaps.

   ```
   Unique strings count: <count>
   ```

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter a string: abca
Enter number of swaps: 2
Unique strings count: 10
```

## Error Handling

- If the input string is empty, the application will notify you that the input cannot be empty.
- If the number of swaps entered is not a valid integer, the application will prompt you to enter a valid number.
