Read the string 'S' from standard input and determine its length 'n = |S|'. Initialize a variable 'count' to store the number of unique strings that can be obtained through swaps. If 'K' is greater than or equal to 'n', set 'count' to the number of unique permutations of 'S' since all characters can be freely swapped. If 'K' is less than 'n', implement a method to generate all possible strings by performing at most 'K' adjacent swaps. Use a set to keep track of unique strings generated from the swaps to avoid duplicates. For each possible swap, recursively call a function 'swap_and_count(current_string, remaining_swaps)' to explore further swaps. In 'swap_and_count', if 'remaining_swaps' is greater than 0, perform adjacent swaps and call the function recursively with the new string and decremented swaps. After exploring all possible swaps, update 'count' with the size of the set containing unique strings. Print the final value of 'count' as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the unique strings generated by the allowed swaps while adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.
