# LCP Calculator

A simple tool for calculating the longest common prefix (LCP) between multiple strings.

## Overview

The LCP Calculator allows users to input a list of strings and computes the maximum longest common prefix for each string against all other strings. This is useful in various applications such as string matching, data compression, and more.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer N and N strings from standard input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that all strings consist of lowercase English letters and that the total length does not exceed 500,000 characters.
- **LCP Calculation**: Computes the longest common prefix between pairs of strings and tracks the maximum LCP for each string.
- **Output Handling**: Prints the maximum LCP values for each string in a user-friendly format.

## Installation

To run the LCP Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The LCP Calculator does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the LCP Calculator.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**:
   - You will be prompted to enter the number of strings (N).
   - Enter the strings one by one, ensuring they consist of lowercase letters only.

4. **View Results**: After entering all strings, the application will compute and display the maximum LCP values for each string.

### Example Usage

```
Enter number of strings (N): 3
Enter string (lowercase letters only): apple
Enter string (lowercase letters only): application
Enter string (lowercase letters only): app
Max LCP values: [3, 3, 3]
```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation and will raise errors for the following cases:
- If N is not a positive integer.
- If any string contains characters other than lowercase English letters.
- If the total length of all strings exceeds 500,000 characters.

## Conclusion

The LCP Calculator is a straightforward tool designed for efficient computation of the longest common prefix among a set of strings. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to our support team.
