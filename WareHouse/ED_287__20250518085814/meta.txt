Task:
Define a function 'max_lcp(strings: List[str]) -> List[int]' that takes a list of strings as input. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the N strings from standard input. Ensure that the input strings are validated to meet the constraints: each string must consist of lowercase English letters and the total length must not exceed 5 * 10^5. Create a helper function 'lcp(x: str, y: str) -> int' to calculate the longest common prefix (LCP) between two strings x and y. Iterate through all pairs of strings (S_i, S_j) where i != j to compute the LCP using the 'lcp' function. Maintain a variable to track the maximum LCP found for each string S_i against all other strings. Store the maximum LCP values for each string in a list or array. Return the list of maximum LCP values from the 'max_lcp' function. Implement output handling to print the maximum LCP values for each string in the required format. Ensure the solution is optimized to handle the upper limits of the constraints efficiently.
