# Ball Picker Application

Count the ways to pick balls from bags such that their product equals a specified target.

## Overview

The Ball Picker application allows users to calculate the number of ways to select balls from multiple bags, where each bag contains a different set of balls. The goal is to find combinations of selected balls whose product equals a given target value.

## Main Functions

- **countWays(N: int, L: List[int], A: List[List[int]], X: int) -> int**: 
  - This function encapsulates the logic for counting the ways to pick balls from bags.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `N`: Number of bags.
    - `L`: List of counts of balls in each bag.
    - `A`: List of lists containing the integers on the balls.
    - `X`: Target product.
  - **Returns**: The number of valid combinations of balls that yield the product equal to `X`.

## Installation

To run the Ball Picker application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: The application requires the `typing` module, which is included in Python 3.5 and later. If you are using an earlier version, please upgrade your Python installation.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Ball Picker application repository from your version control system (e.g., GitHub).

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: You can run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the following:
   - **Number of Bags (N)**: The total number of bags you have.
   - **Counts of Balls (L)**: A comma-separated list of integers representing the number of balls in each bag.
   - **Balls in Bags (A)**: A semicolon-separated list of comma-separated integers representing the balls in each bag. For example, `1,2,3;4,5` means the first bag has balls 1, 2, and 3, while the second bag has balls 4 and 5.
   - **Target Product (X)**: The integer value that the product of selected balls should equal.

2. **Output**: The application will output the number of ways to pick the balls such that their product equals `X`.

## Example

```
Enter number of bags (N): 2
Enter counts of balls (L): 3,2
Enter balls in bags (A): 1,2,3;4,5
Enter target product (X): 12
Number of ways: 2
```

In this example, there are 2 ways to select balls from the bags such that their product equals 12.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to ensure that:
- The lengths of `L` and `A` match `N`.
- The input values are valid integers.

If an error occurs, an appropriate message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Ball Picker application is a powerful tool for combinatorial calculations involving products of integers. With its straightforward interface and robust functionality, it can be easily integrated into larger systems or used as a standalone tool for mathematical exploration.
