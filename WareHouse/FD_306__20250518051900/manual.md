# Set Index Sum Calculator

A Python application for calculating the sum of indices of elements from sets of integers based on specified criteria.

## Quick Install

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:

```
# requirements.txt
```

## ü§î What is this?

This application allows users to input multiple sets of integers and computes the sum of indices of elements from these sets when merged and sorted. The main functionalities include:

- **calculate_f(A, B)**: Computes the sum of indices of elements in set A when merged with set B.
- **merge_and_sort(A, B)**: Merges two sets and returns a sorted list of unique elements.
- **sum_of_f(N, sets)**: Computes the total sum of `f(S_i, S_j)` for all pairs of sets.

## üìñ How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher is recommended).
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.

### Step 2: Run the Application

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
3. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Input Data

When prompted, enter the following:

- **Number of Sets (N)**: The total number of sets you want to input.
- **Number of Elements in Each Set (M)**: The number of elements each set should contain.
- **Sets Input**: Enter the sets as comma-separated integers, separated by semicolons. For example:

```
1,2,3;4,5,6
```

### Example Input

```
Enter number of sets (N): 2
Enter the number of elements in each set (M): 3
Enter sets (comma-separated integers, separated by semicolons, e.g., '1,2,3;4,5,6'): 1,2,3;4,5,6
```

### Step 4: View Results

After entering the data, the application will compute the result and display it in the terminal:

```
Result: <computed_sum>
```

### Error Handling

The application includes error handling for common input issues, such as:

- Duplicate elements in a set.
- Incorrect number of elements in a set.
- Non-integer elements in the input.

If an error occurs, a descriptive message will be printed to the standard error output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Code

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the core functions:

```python
def merge_and_sort(A, B):
    # Merges two sets and returns a sorted list
    merged = list(A.union(B))
    return sorted(merged)

def calculate_f(A, B):
    # Calculates the sum of indices of elements of A in the sorted merged list of A and B
    C = merge_and_sort(A, B)
    index_map = {value: idx for idx, value in enumerate(C)}
    indices_sum = sum(index_map[a] for a in A if a in index_map)
    return indices_sum

def sum_of_f(N, sets):
    # Computes the total sum of f(S_i, S_j) for all pairs (i, j)
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            total_sum += calculate_f(sets[i], sets[j])
    return total_sum
```
