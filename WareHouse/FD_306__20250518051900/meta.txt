Task:
Define a function 'calculate_f(A, B)' that takes two sets of integers A and B as input and returns the value of f(A, B) as described in the problem statement. Implement a function 'merge_and_sort(A, B)' that merges sets A and B, sorts the resulting sequence, and returns the sorted list C. Extract the indices k_1, k_2, ..., k_|A| from the sorted list C for the elements of set A. Calculate the sum of the indices k_1, k_2, ..., k_|A| and return this sum as the output of 'calculate_f(A, B)'. Define a function 'sum_of_f(N, sets)' that takes an integer N and a list of sets of integers, and computes the total sum of f(S_i, S_j) for all pairs (i, j) with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N. Iterate through all pairs of sets (S_i, S_j) in 'sum_of_f(N, sets)' and call 'calculate_f(S_i, S_j)' for each pair. Accumulate the results of 'calculate_f(S_i, S_j)' into a total sum variable within 'sum_of_f(N, sets)'. Implement input handling to read the number of sets N and the elements of each set S_i from standard input. Store the sets in a list of sets, ensuring that each set contains M elements as specified. Output the final computed sum from 'sum_of_f(N, sets)' to standard output.
