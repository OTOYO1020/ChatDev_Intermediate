# Bounce Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of bounces based on user-defined parameters.

## Quick Install

To get started with the Bounce Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, you can clone the repository or download the files directly.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bounce-calculator.git
cd bounce-calculator
```

### Install Dependencies

Currently, there are no external dependencies required for this application. It runs on standard Python libraries.

## ü§î What is Bounce Calculator?

The Bounce Calculator is a Python application designed to determine how many times an object bounces within a specified limit. Users can input the number of bounces, the limit, and the lengths of each bounce to get the total count of bounces that remain within the limit.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The application reads integers `N` (number of bounces) and `X` (bounce limit) from standard input.
   - It also reads a list of integers `L` representing the lengths of each bounce.

2. **Bounce Calculation**:
   - The application initializes the bounce coordinate `D` to 0 and a counter `bounce_count` to 0.
   - It checks if the first bounce (at coordinate 0) is within the limit `X`.
   - It iterates through the list of bounce lengths, updating the coordinate `D` and counting how many bounces are within the limit.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing the bounces, the application outputs the total number of bounces that are within the specified limit.

## üìñ How to Use the Bounce Calculator

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
   - Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of bounces `N` (an integer).
   - Enter the bounce limit `X` (an integer).
   - Enter the list of bounce lengths `L` as space-separated integers.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter N (number of bounces): 5
   Enter X (bounce limit): 10
   Enter L (bounces list, space-separated): 2 3 5 1 4
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   - After entering the data, the application will process the input and display the total number of bounces within the limit.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Number of bounces: 4
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling

- If the length of the list `L` does not match `N`, the application will raise a `ValueError` and display an error message.
- Ensure that the inputs are integers and that the list of bounce lengths is correctly formatted.

## üìÑ Additional Notes

- This application is designed for educational purposes and can be expanded with additional features such as file input/output or graphical user interfaces.
- For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
