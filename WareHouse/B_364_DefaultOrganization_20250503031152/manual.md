# Grid Movement Application

A simple application that allows users to navigate through a grid based on user-defined movements. The grid consists of empty spaces (represented by '.') and blocked spaces (represented by '#'). Users can specify their starting position and the sequence of movements they wish to perform.

## Main Functions

- **Setup Grid**: Users can define the grid's dimensions and configuration.
- **Starting Position**: Users can specify their starting position within the grid.
- **Movement Execution**: Users can input a sequence of movements (L, R, U, D) to navigate through the grid.
- **Final Position Output**: The application outputs the final position after executing the movements.

## Installation

To run the Grid Movement Application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries, but it is recommended to use Python 3.6 or higher.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Grid Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the number of rows (H) and columns (W) for the grid.
   ```
   Enter the number of rows in the grid (H): 5
   Enter the number of columns in the grid (W): 5
   ```

4. **Input Grid Configuration**: For each row, enter a string of length W using '.' for empty spaces and '#' for blocked spaces.
   ```
   Enter row 1 (use '.' for empty and '#' for blocked): .....
   Enter row 2 (use '.' for empty and '#' for blocked): ..#..
   Enter row 3 (use '.' for empty and '#' for blocked): ..#..
   Enter row 4 (use '.' for empty and '#' for blocked): .....
   Enter row 5 (use '.' for empty and '#' for blocked): .....
   ```

5. **Input Starting Position**: Enter the starting row (S_i) and column (S_j) within the valid range.
   ```
   Enter starting row (S_i): 1
   Enter starting column (S_j): 1
   ```

6. **Input Movements**: Enter the sequence of movements you wish to perform (L for left, R for right, U for up, D for down).
   ```
   Enter movements (L, R, U, D): RRUUD
   ```

7. **View Final Position**: The application will output the final position after executing the movements.
   ```
   Final Position: (3, 3)
   ```

## Error Handling

- If invalid integers are entered for grid dimensions or starting positions, the application will prompt the user to enter valid integers.
- If the starting position is blocked, the application will notify the user and ask for a different starting position.
- If invalid movement characters are entered, the application will alert the user and return the starting position.

## Conclusion

The Grid Movement Application provides a simple and interactive way to navigate through a grid. By following the steps outlined in this manual, users can easily set up their grid and execute movements to explore different configurations.
