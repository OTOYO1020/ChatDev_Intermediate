# Square Pair Counter

A simple application to count pairs of integers whose product is a perfect square.

## Overview

The Square Pair Counter application allows users to input a positive integer \( N \) and calculates the number of pairs \( (i, j) \) such that \( 1 \leq i, j \leq N \) and \( i \times j \) is a perfect square. This application is useful for mathematical explorations and can serve as an educational tool for understanding perfect squares and their properties.

## Main Functions

- **count_square_pairs(N: int) -> int**: This function encapsulates the logic for counting valid pairs. It initializes a counter, iterates through all pairs of integers from 1 to \( N \), checks if their product is a perfect square, and returns the total count of such pairs.

- **validate_input(user_input: str) -> bool**: This utility function checks if the user input is a valid positive integer, ensuring that the application only processes valid data.

## Installation

To run the Square Pair Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:

- `math`: This is a built-in library in Python, so no installation is necessary.

To ensure you have the necessary environment, you can create a virtual environment and install any additional dependencies using pip if needed.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv square_pair_counter_env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
square_pair_counter_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source square_pair_counter_env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (if any additional packages are required)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements file
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Number**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \). The application will validate the input. If the input is valid, it will calculate the number of valid pairs and display the result.

3. **Output**: The application will output the total count of pairs \( (i, j) \) for the given \( N \) where \( i \times j \) is a perfect square.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter a number (N): 5
Result: 9
```

In this example, the application found 9 pairs where the product is a perfect square.

## Conclusion

The Square Pair Counter application is a straightforward tool for counting integer pairs based on the properties of perfect squares. It is designed to be user-friendly and educational, making it suitable for users interested in mathematics.
