Task:
Define a function 'count_square_pairs(N: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting pairs. Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to keep track of the number of valid pairs (i, j). Use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i, j <= N. For each pair (i, j), calculate the product 'product = i * j'. Check if 'product' is a perfect square by taking the integer square root and squaring it again. If 'product' is a perfect square, increment the 'count' variable by 1. After iterating through all pairs, return the value of 'count'. Handle input by reading an integer N from standard input. Call the function 'count_square_pairs(N)' with the input value. Output the result as an integer.
