# String Manipulator

A simple application for performing character replacement operations on strings.

## Quick Install

To run the String Manipulator application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The String Manipulator application allows users to perform a series of character replacement operations on a given string. Users can specify multiple operations, and the application will apply these operations sequentially, ensuring that replacements do not interfere with each other.

### Main Functions

- **Input String**: The application prompts the user to enter a string `S` that they wish to manipulate.
- **Operations**: Users can define a number of operations `Q`, where each operation consists of two characters: the character to be replaced and the character to replace it with.
- **Sequential Replacements**: The application processes each operation in the order they were entered, allowing for complex transformations of the input string.
- **Output**: After all operations have been applied, the modified string is displayed.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the String**: When prompted, enter the string `S` that you want to manipulate. Ensure that the string is not empty.

   ```
   Enter the string S: hello world
   ```

3. **Specify the Number of Operations**: Enter the number of operations `Q` you wish to perform.

   ```
   Enter the number of operations Q: 2
   ```

4. **Enter Operations**: For each operation, input two characters separated by a space. For example, to replace 'h' with 'H', you would enter:

   ```
   Please enter each operation as two characters separated by a space (e.g., 'a b' to replace 'a' with 'b'):
   h H
   o O
   ```

5. **View the Result**: After entering all operations, the application will display the modified string.

   ```
   Result: HellO WOrld
   ```

## Edge Cases

- If the input string `S` is empty, the application will notify the user that the string cannot be empty.
- If the number of operations `Q` is less than or equal to zero, the application will prompt the user to enter a valid number.
- The application will also validate the format of each operation to ensure that only two single characters are entered.

## Conclusion

The String Manipulator is a straightforward tool for performing character replacements in strings. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy to manipulate strings according to user-defined rules. For any issues or feedback, please reach out to the development team.
