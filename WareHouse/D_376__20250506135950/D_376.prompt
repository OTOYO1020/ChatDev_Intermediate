Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of vertices and edges in the directed graph. Initialize an adjacency list 'graph' to store the directed edges. For each edge (i from 1 to M), read the pair of integers (a_i, b_i) and populate the 'graph' with directed edges from vertex a_i to vertex b_i. Implement a depth-first search (DFS) function 'dfs(vertex, visited, stack)' to detect cycles in the graph, starting from vertex 1. Maintain a 'visited' set to track visited vertices and a 'stack' to keep track of the current path in the DFS. If a cycle is detected during the DFS, calculate the length of the cycle by tracking the vertices in the 'stack'. Keep track of the minimum cycle length that includes vertex 1. After completing the DFS, check if a cycle containing vertex 1 was found and store the result. Print the minimum number of edges in the cycle if it exists; otherwise, print an indication that no such cycle exists.\n\nOutput format:\n- If a cycle exists, output the minimum number of edges in that cycle.\n- If no cycle exists containing vertex 1, output a message indicating that no such cycle exists.
