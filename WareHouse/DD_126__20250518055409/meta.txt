Task:
Define a function 'color_tree(N: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[str]' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of vertices and edges is a list of tuples containing the edges and their weights. Parse the input to extract the number of vertices N and the list of edges, ensuring to read the edges in the format (u_i, v_i, w_i). Construct an adjacency list representation of the tree using the edges provided, ensuring that each vertex points to its connected vertices. Implement a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the tree and determine the levels (or depths) of each vertex. Assign colors to the vertices based on their levels: color even-level vertices one color (e.g., 'white') and odd-level vertices another color (e.g., 'black'). Ensure that the coloring satisfies the condition that any two vertices of the same color have an even distance between them. Handle edge cases where all vertices can be painted the same color by checking if N is 1 or if the tree structure allows for a uniform color. Return the list of colors assigned to each vertex in the order from vertex 1 to N. Implement error handling for invalid input formats or constraints that do not meet the problem requirements. Print the output in the required format, ensuring that the colors are displayed as a space-separated string.
