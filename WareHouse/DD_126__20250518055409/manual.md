# Tree Coloring Application

A Python application for coloring the vertices of a tree based on their levels.

## Overview

The Tree Coloring application allows users to define a tree structure using vertices and edges, and then colors the vertices based on their levels in the tree. Even-level vertices are colored one color (e.g., 'white'), while odd-level vertices are colored another color (e.g., 'black'). The application ensures that any two vertices of the same color have an even distance between them.

## Main Functions

- **color_tree(N: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[str]**: This function takes the number of vertices and a list of edges, constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, and colors the vertices based on their levels.

## Installation

To run the Tree Coloring application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, ensure you have the necessary libraries such as `collections` and `typing` which are part of the Python standard library.*

## Usage

To use the Tree Coloring application, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your input data:
   - The first line should contain an integer representing the number of vertices (N).
   - The subsequent lines should contain edges in the format `u,v,w`, where `u` and `v` are the vertices connected by the edge and `w` is the weight of the edge.

   Example input:
   ```
   5
   1,2,1
   1,3,1
   2,4,1
   2,5,1
   ```

2. Run the application:
   - You can run the application from the command line and provide the input through standard input (stdin). For example:

```bash
python main.py < input.txt
```

Where `input.txt` contains your input data.

3. Output:
   - The application will print the colors assigned to each vertex in the order from vertex 1 to N as a space-separated string.

   Example output:
   ```
   white black black white white
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input issues:
- If the number of vertices is less than 1, it will prompt an error message.
- If the edges are not in the correct format, it will notify the user.
- It checks if the graph is connected and if the number of edges is exactly N - 1 for a valid tree structure.

## Conclusion

The Tree Coloring application is a simple yet effective tool for visualizing tree structures and their properties. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and run the application to color trees based on their levels.
