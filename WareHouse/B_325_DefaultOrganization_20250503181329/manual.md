# Meeting Participant Calculator

A software tool designed to calculate the maximum number of employees that can participate in a meeting across multiple bases, taking into account their local times and working hours.

## Main Functions

The Meeting Participant Calculator performs the following key functions:

1. **Input Gathering**: Reads the number of bases, the number of employees at each base, and their respective local times.
2. **UTC Conversion**: Converts local times to UTC to standardize the meeting time across different bases.
3. **Time Slot Calculation**: Determines valid meeting time slots based on the working hours of 9 AM to 6 PM in UTC.
4. **Maximum Participants Calculation**: Iterates through all possible meeting start times to find the maximum number of employees that can participate in a meeting.

## Installation

To run the Meeting Participant Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

No additional dependencies are required beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: The program will prompt you to enter the number of bases. Enter an integer value (N) representing the number of bases.

   ```
   Enter number of bases: 
   ```

3. **Enter Employee and Time Data**: For each base, you will be prompted to enter the number of employees and the local time (in hours, from 0 to 23) in a space-separated format. For example:

   ```
   Enter number of employees and local time for base 1 (space-separated): 10 14
   ```

   Repeat this step for all bases.

4. **View Results**: After entering the data, the program will calculate and display the maximum number of employees that can participate in a meeting based on the provided inputs.

   ```
   Maximum number of participants: X
   ```

## Example Usage

   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the number of bases:

   ```
   Enter number of bases: 2
   ```

3. Input the employee and local time data for each base:

   ```
   Enter number of employees and local time for base 1 (space-separated): 10 14
   Enter number of employees and local time for base 2 (space-separated): 5 10
   ```

4. The output will show the maximum number of participants:

   ```
