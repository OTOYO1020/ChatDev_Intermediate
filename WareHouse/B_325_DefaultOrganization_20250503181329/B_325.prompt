Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of bases. Initialize a list 'W' to store the number of employees at each base and a list 'X' to store the local time at each base. For each base i from 1 to N:\n   - Read the number of employees 'W[i]' and the local time 'X[i]' for base i. Convert the local time 'X[i]' to UTC time for each base using the formula: 'UTC[i] = (X[i] - 0 + 24) % 24'. Determine the valid meeting time slots for each base:\n   - Calculate the start time as 'start[i] = (9 - UTC[i] + 24) % 24' and the end time as 'end[i] = (18 - UTC[i] + 24) % 24'. Create a list of tuples 'time_slots' containing the start and end times for each base. Iterate through all possible meeting start times from 0 to 23:\n   - For each start time, calculate the end time as 'start_time + 1'.\n   - Count the total number of employees that can participate based on the valid time slots. Keep track of the maximum number of employees that can participate across all possible meeting start times. Print the maximum number of employees that can participate in the meeting. Ensure that the output is formatted as a single integer representing the maximum number of participants.
