# Query Processing Software

Efficiently handle and process queries related to part positions in a structured manner.

## Overview

This software allows users to manage a series of parts, each represented by coordinates in a 2D space. Users can execute queries to update the positions of these parts based on specified directions or retrieve the current coordinates of specific parts. 

## Main Functions

1. **process_queries(N: int, Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, str]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]**
   - **Parameters:**
     - `N`: The number of parts (must be a positive integer).
     - `Q`: The number of queries (must be a positive integer).
     - `queries`: A list of tuples where each tuple represents a query.
   - **Returns:** A list of tuples containing the coordinates of parts for type 2 queries.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Initializes part positions.
     - Processes two types of queries:
       - Type 1 (`1 C`): Updates the head's position based on direction `C` ('R', 'L', 'U', 'D').
       - Type 2 (`2 p`): Retrieves the coordinates of part `p`.

2. **QueryHandler Class**
   - Manages the logic for updating and retrieving part positions.
   - Contains methods to update positions based on direction and to get the position of a specific part.

## Installation

To run the software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   You can install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, ensure you have the following packages:
   - `typing` (for type hints, if using Python < 3.9)

## Usage

1. **Running the Application**
   - Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**
   - When prompted, enter the number of parts (N) and the number of queries (Q).
   - For each query, input in the format:
     - Type 1: `1 C` (where `C` is one of 'R', 'L', 'U', 'D')
     - Type 2: `2 p` (where `p` is the part index)

3. **Example Input**
   ```
   Enter the number of parts (N): 5
   Enter the number of queries (Q): 3
   Enter query (format: '1 C' or '2 p'): 1 R
   Enter query (format: '1 C' or '2 p'): 2 1
   Enter query (format: '1 C' or '2 p'): 2 2
   ```

4. **Output**
   - The application will print the coordinates of the specified parts after processing the queries.

## Error Handling

The software includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- Invalid input for N or Q (must be positive integers).
- Mismatched number of queries.
- Invalid query format or type.
- Out-of-range part index for type 2 queries.

## Conclusion

This software provides a robust solution for managing and querying part positions in a 2D space. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the support team.
