Task:
Define the function 'count_friend_candidates(N: int, friendships: List[Tuple[int, int]], blockships: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the values of N, M, and K, as well as the lists of friendships and blockships. Initialize a data structure (e.g., adjacency list) to represent friendships between users. Populate the friendships data structure using the provided friendships list. Initialize a data structure to represent blockships between users. Populate the blockships data structure using the provided blockships list. For each user, iterate through all other users to check if they meet the friend candidate conditions. Implement the logic to check for the four conditions that define a friend candidate. Count the number of friend candidates for each user and store the results in a list. Return the list of counts as the output of the function.
