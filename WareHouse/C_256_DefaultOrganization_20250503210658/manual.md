# Grid Filler Application

The Grid Filler application is designed to compute the number of valid configurations for filling a 3x3 grid based on specified row and column sums. This application utilizes a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible configurations and count those that meet the given constraints.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads six positive integers representing the row sums \( h_1, h_2, h_3 \) and column sums \( w_1, w_2, w_3 \).
- **Grid Initialization**: A 3x3 grid is initialized to store positive integers.
- **Count Configurations**: The `count_ways(h, w)` function calculates the total number of valid configurations that satisfy the row and column sums using a recursive backtracking approach.
- **Output**: The application prints the total number of valid configurations.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Grid Filler application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv grid_filler_env
   source grid_filler_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `grid_filler_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**: The application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library, so no additional packages are required.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Row and Column Sums**: When prompted, enter six positive integers separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter six integers (h1, h2, h3, w1, w2, w3): 3 3 3 3 3 3
   ```

3. **View the Output**: After entering the integers, the application will compute and display the total number of valid configurations that can fill the grid according to the specified sums.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to run the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter six integers (h1, h2, h3, w1, w2, w3): 3 3 3 3 3 3
Total valid configurations: 6
```

## Conclusion

The Grid Filler application provides a straightforward way to explore the combinatorial possibilities of filling a grid based on specific constraints. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and run the application to find the number of valid configurations for their specified row and column sums.
