# Absolute Difference Calculator

A Python application for calculating the total sum of absolute differences between integers in an array.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a list of integers and computes the cumulative sum of absolute differences between each pair of integers in the sorted array. The application is designed to handle input validation and provides clear error messages for incorrect inputs.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer N and an array of N integers from standard input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the input values are valid integers and that the number of integers matches N.
- **Calculation**: Computes the total sum of absolute differences between all pairs of integers in the sorted array.
- **Output**: Displays the final result of the total sum.

## Installation

To run the Absolute Difference Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. You can run the application directly without additional installations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. If you have the files, ensure they are in the same directory.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Data**: When prompted, enter the number of integers (N) followed by the integers themselves, separated by spaces. For example:

   ```
   Enter the number of integers (N): 5
   Enter the integers separated by spaces: 3 1 4 1 5
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After entering the data, the application will calculate and display the total sum of absolute differences.

   ```
   Total Sum of Absolute Differences: 16
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure that:

- N is a positive integer.
- All elements in the array are valid integers.
- The number of integers entered matches the specified N.

If any input is invalid, the application will display an appropriate error message.

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to use the Absolute Difference Calculator:

1. Start the application.
2. Input the number of integers:

   ```
   Enter the number of integers (N): 4
   ```

3. Input the integers:

   ```
   Enter the integers separated by spaces: 2 7 1 3
   ```

4. The application will output:

   ```
   Total Sum of Absolute Differences: 18
   ```

## Conclusion

The Absolute Difference Calculator is a simple yet effective tool for computing the total sum of absolute differences in an array of integers. With its user-friendly interface and robust error handling, it is suitable for both novice and experienced users.
