Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers in the array. Read the array A of size N containing integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to store the cumulative sum of absolute differences. Sort the array A to facilitate the calculation of absolute differences. Loop through the sorted array A with index 'i' from 0 to N-2:\n   - For each 'i', loop with index 'j' from 'i+1' to N-1:\n     - Calculate the absolute difference 'diff = A[j] - A[i]' (since A is sorted, A[j] >= A[i]).\n     - Update 'total_sum' by adding 'diff'. Print the final value of 'total_sum' as the result.
