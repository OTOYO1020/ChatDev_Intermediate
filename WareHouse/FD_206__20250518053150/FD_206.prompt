Define the function 'determine_winner(T: int, intervals: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[str]' to handle the input format, where 'T' is the number of test cases and 'intervals' is a list of tuples representing the half-open intervals [L_i, R_i). Parse the input to extract the number of test cases 'T' and the list of intervals for each test case. Implement a function 'is_non_intersecting(interval1: Tuple[int, int], interval2: Tuple[int, int]) -> bool' to check if two intervals do not intersect. Create a function 'find_winner(intervals: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> str' that determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy for Alice and Bob. Sort the intervals based on their starting point 'L_i' to facilitate the selection process. Iterate through the sorted intervals and use a greedy approach to simulate the game, keeping track of the chosen intervals. Determine the winner based on the number of intervals chosen and the rules of the game (odd/even count). Store the results of each test case in a list to be returned by the main function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when there are no intervals or only one interval. Format the output as a list of strings indicating the winner for each test case.
