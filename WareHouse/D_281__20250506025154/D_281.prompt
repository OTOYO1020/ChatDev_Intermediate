Read integers N, K, and D from standard input. Read the sequence of non-negative integers A of length N. Generate all possible sums of K distinct elements from A and store them in a set S. Initialize a variable 'max_multiple' to -1 to keep track of the greatest multiple of D found. Iterate through each sum in S:\n   - If the sum is a multiple of D, update 'max_multiple' if the sum is greater than the current 'max_multiple'. After checking all sums, if 'max_multiple' is still -1, print '-1'. Otherwise, print the value of 'max_multiple'.
