# Sum Calculator

A Python application for calculating the maximum multiple of a given integer from the sums of distinct elements in a sequence.

## Main Functions

The Sum Calculator consists of two main components:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads integers N, K, and D, and a sequence of non-negative integers A from the user.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Generates all possible sums of K distinct elements from A and finds the maximum multiple of D.

### Key Features

- Validates user input for non-negative integers.
- Handles edge cases such as empty input, negative integers, and mismatched lengths.
- Efficiently computes sums using combinations from the itertools library.
- Returns the maximum multiple of D or -1 if no such multiple exists.

## Installation

To run the Sum Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application requires the following Python library:

- `itertools` (part of the Python standard library, no installation needed)

To ensure you have the latest version of Python, you can check your version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If you need to install Python, follow the instructions on the official website.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the code files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Requirements**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:

   - **N**: Length of the array (integer).
   - **K**: Number of distinct elements to sum (positive integer).
   - **D**: The integer to find multiples of.
   - **A**: A sequence of non-negative integers (comma-separated, no spaces).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter N (length of array): 5
   Enter K (number of elements to sum): 3
   Enter D (multiple to find): 4
   Enter the sequence of non-negative integers (comma-separated, no spaces): 1,2,3,4,5
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will compute the sums and display the maximum multiple of D found among the sums. If no multiples are found, it will display `-1`.

   Example output:
   ```
   The maximum multiple of D is: 6
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input scenarios:

- If K is not a positive integer, an error message will be displayed.
- If the sequence of integers is empty or contains negative values, appropriate error messages will guide the user to correct their input.
- If K is greater than N, an error message will indicate that this is not allowed.

## Conclusion

The Sum Calculator is a powerful tool for quickly finding the maximum multiple of a specified integer from sums of distinct elements in a sequence. With its user-friendly interface and robust error handling, it is designed to assist users in performing calculations efficiently.
