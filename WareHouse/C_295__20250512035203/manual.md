# Sock Pair Calculator

Calculate the maximum number of pairs of socks that can be formed from a list of sock colors.

## Overview

The Sock Pair Calculator is a Python application designed to help users determine how many pairs of socks can be formed based on the colors of the socks they have. The application takes the total number of socks and their respective colors as input and outputs the maximum number of pairs.

## Main Functions

- **max_pairs(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int**: This function calculates the maximum number of pairs of socks that can be formed from the provided list of sock colors.
  
- **validate_input(N: int, A: List[int]) -> bool**: This function validates the input values to ensure they meet the specified constraints.

## Installation

To run the Sock Pair Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the Sock Pair Calculator code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application requires no external libraries beyond the standard library, but ensure you have the following modules available:

   - `collections`
   - `typing`

   These modules are included in Python's standard library, so no additional installation is necessary.

## Usage

To use the Sock Pair Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the number of socks (N) and the sock colors as a comma-separated list. For example:

   ```
   Enter number of socks (N): 6
   Enter sock colors (comma-separated): 1,2,1,2,1,3
   ```

3. **View Results**: The application will validate your input and calculate the maximum number of pairs. If the input is valid, it will display the result:

   ```
   Maximum pairs: 2
   ```

### Input Constraints

- The number of socks (N) must be between 1 and 500,000.
- Each sock color must be a positive integer (1 ≤ A_i ≤ 1,000,000,000).

### Error Handling

The application includes error handling for invalid inputs. If the input does not meet the specified constraints, an error message will be displayed, prompting the user to enter valid integers.

## Example Scenarios

- **Valid Input**: 
  ```
  Enter number of socks (N): 8
  Enter sock colors (comma-separated): 1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3
  Maximum pairs: 4
  ```

- **Invalid Input**: 
  ```
  Enter number of socks (N): 0
  Invalid input. Please ensure that N is between 1 and 500,000 and matches the number of sock colors provided.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Sock Pair Calculator is a simple yet effective tool for determining the maximum number of sock pairs based on color. With easy installation and user-friendly input, it serves as a practical solution for anyone looking to organize their sock collection.
