# Monster Battle Game

Welcome to the Monster Battle Game! This application allows players to engage in a thrilling battle against a monster by utilizing special moves to reduce its health. 

## Main Functions

- **Input Monster's Health (H)**: Enter the monster's health as a positive integer.
- **Input Special Moves (N)**: Enter a list of special moves as comma-separated positive integers representing the damage values.
- **Damage Calculation**: The application calculates the total damage possible from the special moves and checks if it can defeat the monster.
- **Health Check**: The game checks if the monster's health can be reduced to zero or below using the provided moves.

## Installation

To run the Monster Battle Game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: Currently, there are no external dependencies required for this application.

## How to Use/Play

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Monster's Health**: When prompted, enter the monster's health as a positive integer (e.g., `100`).

3. **Input Special Moves**: Next, enter the special moves as a comma-separated list of positive integers (e.g., `10,20,30`). If you have no moves, simply enter `0`.

4. **Game Logic**: The application will:
   - Validate the inputs.
   - Calculate the total damage from the special moves.
   - Check if the total damage is sufficient to defeat the monster.
   - Sort the moves in descending order and apply them to the monster's health.
   - Output "Yes" if the monster can be defeated, or "No" if it cannot.

5. **Edge Cases**: The application handles edge cases where:
   - The number of moves is zero.
   - The moves do not sum up to the monster's health.

## Example

```
Enter Monster's Health (H, positive integer): 100
Enter Special Moves (comma-separated positive integers, e.g., 10,20,30). Enter '0' if no moves: 20,30,50
Yes
```

In this example, the total damage from the moves (20 + 30 + 50 = 100) is equal to the monster's health, resulting in a victory.

## Conclusion

Enjoy battling the monster with your special moves! If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out for support.
