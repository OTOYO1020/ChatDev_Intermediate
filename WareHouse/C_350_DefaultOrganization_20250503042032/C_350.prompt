Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the permutation. Read the permutation array A of length N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'swap_count' to 0 to keep track of the number of swaps performed. Create a loop that continues until the array A is sorted in ascending order (i.e., A equals (1, 2, ..., N)). Within the loop, find the first index 'i' where A[i] is not equal to i + 1 (the expected value). Find the index 'j' of the correct value that should be at position 'i' (i.e., the value that should be A[i] is i + 1). Swap the elements at indices 'i' and 'j' in array A. Increment 'swap_count' by 1 after each swap. Repeat steps 4 to 8 until the array A is sorted. Print the total number of swaps performed ('swap_count').
