Task:
story : You heard a song consisting of NN notes in fits and starts. You want to guess whether a phrase consisting of MM sounds was included in this song. You also want to consider cases where the phrase is included in a different key than the original. Problem Statement : You are given two sequences of non-negative integers, A=(A1,…,AN)A=(A1,…,AN) and B=(B1,…,BM)B=(B1,…,BM), each of length NN and MM, respectively. Find the number of integers ii that satisfy 1≤i≤N−M+11≤i≤N−M+1 and meet the following condition: Define a contiguous subsequence CC of length MM of AA as C=(Ai,…,Ai+M−1)C=(Ai,…,Ai+M−1). Next, update all elements of the sequences BB and CC that are 00 with any positive real number (the updated values may be different for each element). Then, determine an arbitrary positive real number tt, and multiply all elements of sequence CC by tt. By doing so, the sequences BB and CC can be made identical.
