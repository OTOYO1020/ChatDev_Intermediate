# Point Line Calculator

A Python application designed to analyze points in a 2D space and determine the number of unique lines formed by those points. It identifies lines that contain a specified minimum number of points and checks for collinearity among points.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of points and their coordinates from the user.
- **Line Calculation**: Computes the slopes and intercepts of lines formed by pairs of points, counting how many points lie on each line.
- **Output Display**: Presents the results to the user, including the number of valid lines or indicating if all points are collinear.

## Installation

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install collections math
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script `main.py` in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Points**: When prompted, enter the total number of points (N) you want to analyze.

   ```
   Enter number of points (N): 
   ```

3. **Input the Minimum Points on a Line**: Next, specify the minimum number of points (K) that must lie on a line for it to be considered valid.

   ```
   Enter minimum number of points on a line (K): 
   ```

4. **Input the Coordinates**: Enter the coordinates of the points in the format `(X1, Y1) (X2, Y2) ... (XN, YN)` separated by spaces. Ensure the number of coordinates matches `N`.

   ```
   Enter N points (X, Y) separated by spaces:
   ```

5. **View Results**: The application will process the input and display the results, indicating the number of valid lines or if all points are collinear.

   ```
   Number of valid lines: X
   ```

   or

   ```
   Infinity
   ```

## Example Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input example:

   ```
   Enter number of points (N): 5
   Enter minimum number of points on a line (K): 3
   Enter 5 points (X, Y) separated by spaces: 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
   ```

3. Output:

   ```
   Number of valid lines: 1
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure that the input format is strictly followed to avoid errors.
- The application handles edge cases where K = 1, treating each point as a valid line.
- If there are fewer than two points, the application will return 0 valid lines.
