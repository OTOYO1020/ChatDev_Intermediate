# Set Combination Validator

A Python application for validating combinations of integer sets against a specified range.

## Overview

This software allows users to input multiple sets of integers and checks how many combinations of these sets can cover all integers from 1 to N. It utilizes bit manipulation to efficiently generate and evaluate all possible combinations of the provided sets.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the number of sets (M) and the maximum integer (N) to be covered.
2. **Set Management**: Users can input unique integers for each set, which are stored and managed by the application.
3. **Combination Validation**: The application calculates how many combinations of the sets can cover all integers from 1 to N and outputs the result.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not have any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of sets (M) and the maximum integer (N). Then, for each set, input the size of the set followed by the unique integers.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter number of sets (M): 3
   Enter the maximum integer (N): 5
   Enter the size of set 1 (must be unique integers): 3
   Enter exactly 3 unique integers separated by space: 1 2 3
   Enter the size of set 2 (must be unique integers): 2
   Enter exactly 2 unique integers separated by space: 4 5
   Enter the size of set 3 (must be unique integers): 2
   Enter exactly 2 unique integers separated by space: 1 4
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering all sets, the application will calculate and display the number of valid combinations that cover all integers from 1 to N.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Valid combinations: 4
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure that all integers entered for each set are unique.
- The application uses 1-based indexing for sets, meaning the first set is referred to as set 1.
- If invalid input is detected (e.g., non-integer values or duplicate integers), the application will prompt the user to re-enter the data.
