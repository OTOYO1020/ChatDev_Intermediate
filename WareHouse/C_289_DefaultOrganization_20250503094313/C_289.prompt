Read integers M and N from standard input. Initialize a list of sets 'S' to store the integer sets. For each set index i from 1 to M:\n   - Read the integer C_i (the size of the set).\n   - Read the next C_i integers and store them in the set 'S[i]'. Initialize a counter 'valid_count' to zero to keep track of valid combinations. Generate all possible combinations of the sets using bit manipulation (from 1 to 2^M - 1). For each combination, create a union set 'chosen_set' to store unique integers from the selected sets. Check if 'chosen_set' contains all integers from 1 to N:\n   - If it does, increment 'valid_count'. After evaluating all combinations, print the value of 'valid_count' as the result.
