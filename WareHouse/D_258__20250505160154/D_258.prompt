Read integers N and X from standard input. Read the array A of length N, which contains the movie durations for each stage. Read the array B of length N, which contains the gameplay durations for each stage. Initialize a variable 'total_time' to 0 to keep track of the total time needed to clear stages. Loop through each stage from 1 to N:\n   - For the first time clearing stage i (1 ≤ i ≤ N):\n     - Add A[i-1] (movie time) and B[i-1] (gameplay time) to 'total_time'.\n   - For subsequent clears of stage i (X - 1 times):\n     - Add B[i-1] (gameplay time) to 'total_time'. If the stage is cleared multiple times, ensure to account for the total clears needed for each stage. Print the final value of 'total_time'.
