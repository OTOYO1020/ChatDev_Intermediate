# Movie and Gameplay Duration Calculator

This software calculates the total time needed to clear stages in a game, taking into account both movie durations and gameplay durations.

## Main Functions

- **Calculate Total Time**: The core function of the software that computes the total time required to clear all stages based on user input.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input values for the number of stages, number of clears, and durations are valid and non-negative.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Prompts the user for input and displays the total time in a clear format.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Movie and Gameplay Duration Calculator, you need to set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (currently empty but can be updated for future enhancements):
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Software

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of stages (N) and the number of clears (X).
   - Enter the movie durations as a comma-separated list (e.g., `120,90,150`).
   - Enter the gameplay durations as a comma-separated list (e.g., `30,45,60`).

3. **View Results**:
   After entering the data, the software will calculate and display the total time required to clear all stages.

## Example Usage

```
Enter number of stages (N): 3
Enter number of clears (X): 2
Enter movie durations (comma-separated): 120,90,150
Enter gameplay durations (comma-separated): 30,45,60
Total Time: 525
```

## Error Handling

The software includes input validation to handle errors such as:
- Non-positive integers for N and X.
- Mismatched lengths of movie and gameplay duration lists.
- Negative values in the duration lists.

If an error occurs, a descriptive message will be displayed to guide the user in correcting their input.

## Future Enhancements

This software is designed with potential future enhancements in mind. As new features are developed, they will be documented here.
