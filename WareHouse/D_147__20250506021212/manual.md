# XOR Calculator

A simple application to calculate the total XOR sum of a list of integers.

## Overview

The XOR Calculator allows users to input a series of integers and computes the total XOR sum of all unique pairs of integers. The result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow. This application is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy to perform XOR calculations.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the number of integers and the integers themselves.
- **XOR Calculation**: It calculates the XOR for each unique pair of integers and accumulates the results.
- **Output**: The final total XOR sum is displayed to the user.

## Installation

To run the XOR Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the XOR Calculator code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main Python file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the total number of integers you wish to input.
   - Next, enter the integers separated by spaces.

   Example:
   ```
   Please enter the total number of integers you wish to input: 5
   Please enter 5 integers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After entering the integers, the application will calculate and display the total XOR sum.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Total XOR sum: 24
   ```

5. **Error Handling**: If the number of integers entered does not match the expected count, or if invalid input is provided, the application will prompt you to try again.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Please enter the total number of integers you wish to input: 4
Please enter 4 integers separated by spaces: 10 20 30 40
Total XOR sum: 220
```

## Conclusion

The XOR Calculator is a straightforward tool for performing XOR calculations on a list of integers. It is designed to be intuitive and efficient, making it suitable for both casual users and developers looking for a quick solution to XOR summation problems.
