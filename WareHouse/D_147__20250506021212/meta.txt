Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers. Read the N integers into an array A, where each element A[i] corresponds to the i-th integer. Initialize a variable 'total_xor_sum' to 0 to accumulate the result of the XOR sums. Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of indices (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N:\n   - For each pair (i, j), calculate the XOR value using 'xor_value = A[i] ^ A[j]'.\n   - Add 'xor_value' to 'total_xor_sum'. Since the result can be large, take 'total_xor_sum' modulo (10^9 + 7) after each addition to prevent overflow. After completing the nested loop, print the final value of 'total_xor_sum'.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function: 'calculate_xor_sum(N, A)'\n- Variables: 'total_xor_sum', 'xor_value', 'A', 'N'\n\n### Input Format:\n- The input consists of an integer N followed by N integers. This will be handled by reading from standard input.\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output will be a single integer representing the total XOR sum modulo (10^9 + 7).
