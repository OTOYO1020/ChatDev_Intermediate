Define a function named 'find_smallest_integer(N)' that takes an integer 'N' as input. Check if 'N' is within the constraints (0 <= N <= 10^18). If not, handle the error appropriately. Initialize a variable 'X' to 'N'. Create a loop that continues until a valid 'X' is found. Within the loop, check if there exist non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' such that 'X = a^3 + a^2 * b + a * b^2 + b^3'. If such a pair '(a, b)' is found, return 'X'. If not, increment 'X' by 1 and repeat the check. Ensure to implement a method to efficiently check for pairs '(a, b)' for the given 'X'. Consider the maximum possible values for 'a' and 'b' based on the constraints to optimize the search. Output the smallest integer 'X' that satisfies the conditions.
