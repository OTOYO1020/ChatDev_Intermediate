Here is the `manual.md` file for the software that implements the function `find_smallest_integer(N)`:

```markdown
# Find Smallest Integer

A Python application to find the smallest integer \( X \) that can be expressed in the form \( X = a^3 + a^2 \cdot b + a \cdot b^2 + b^3 \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \).

## Quick Install

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:

```
# requirements.txt
# Add any required libraries here, if needed
```

## ü§î What is this?

This application allows users to input an integer \( N \) and finds the smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the equation mentioned above. The application checks if \( N \) is within the valid range (0 to \( 10^{18} \)) and efficiently searches for pairs of non-negative integers \( (a, b) \) that satisfy the equation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Functions

- **`find_smallest_integer(N)`**: 
  - Takes an integer \( N \) as input.
  - Validates the input to ensure it is within the range [0, \( 10^{18} \)].
  - Initializes \( X \) to \( N \) and searches for the smallest integer \( X \) that can be expressed in the specified form.

- **`is_valid_input(N)`**: 
  - Checks if the input \( N \) is within the valid range.

- **`check_pairs(X)`**: 
  - Checks for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( X = a^3 + a^2 \cdot b + a \cdot b^2 + b^3 \).
  - Optimized to reduce the number of iterations for finding valid pairs.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input an Integer**:
   - When prompted, enter an integer \( N \) within the range [0, \( 10^{18} \)].

3. **View the Result**:
   - The application will output the smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the equation. If the input is invalid, an error message will be displayed.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter an integer N (0 <= N <= 10^18): 10
The smallest integer X is: 10
```
