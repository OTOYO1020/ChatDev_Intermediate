Read the integer N from standard input. Initialize a counter 'count' to zero to keep track of numbers with exactly 9 positive divisors. Iterate through all integers 'i' from 1 to N:\n   - For each integer 'i', call the function 'count_divisors(i)' to determine the number of positive divisors of 'i'. In the 'count_divisors(i)' function:\n   - Initialize a variable 'divisor_count' to zero.\n   - Loop through all integers 'j' from 1 to the square root of 'i':\n     - If 'j' divides 'i', increment 'divisor_count' by 1 for 'j' and by 1 for 'i/j' (if they are different).\n   - Return 'divisor_count'. If the result from 'count_divisors(i)' equals 9, increment the 'count' by 1. After completing the iteration, print the value of 'count' as the final result.
