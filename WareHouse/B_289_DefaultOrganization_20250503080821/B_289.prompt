Read integers N and M from standard input, followed by the array of integers \( a \) of size M. Initialize an undirected graph \( G \) with \( N \) vertices, numbered from 1 to N. Add edges to the graph \( G \) based on the 'ãƒ¬' marks, connecting vertex \( a_i \) to vertex \( a_i + 1 \) for each \( i \) from 1 to M. Initialize a list to keep track of the order of integers to be read. Create a set to track unread integers from 1 to N. While there are unread integers:\n   - Find the minimum unread integer \( x \).\n   - Determine the connected component \( C \) containing vertex \( x \) using a graph traversal method (e.g., DFS or BFS).\n   - Read all integers in component \( C \) in descending order and append them to the order list.\n   - Mark these integers as read (remove them from the unread set). Print the order of integers read as a space-separated string.\n\n### Input Format:\n- The input will be handled by reading from standard input using 'input()' or similar methods to capture \( N \), \( M \), and the array \( a \).\n\n### Function to Call:\n- The main function can be named 'determine_reading_order(N, M, a)' which will encapsulate the above logic.\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output will be a single line containing the order of integers read, printed as a space-separated string.
