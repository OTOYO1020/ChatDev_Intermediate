# Graph Reading Order Application

This application reads integers and determines the order in which they should be processed based on their connectivity in an undirected graph.

## Overview

The Graph Reading Order Application allows users to input a set of integers and an array that defines connections between them. The application constructs an undirected graph and determines the order of reading integers based on their connected components.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers \( N \) (number of vertices) and \( M \) (size of the array), followed by the array of integers \( a \).
- **Graph Construction**: Initializes an undirected graph with \( N \) vertices and adds edges based on the connections defined in the array \( a \).
- **Connected Component Retrieval**: Uses graph traversal methods (BFS) to find connected components.
- **Order Determination**: Outputs the integers in descending order based on their connectivity.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application uses standard libraries, so no additional packages are required. However, ensure you have `collections` and `deque` available, which are included in Python's standard library.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: You can run the application from the command line. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: Provide the input in the following format:
   ```
   N
   M
   a1 a2 a3 ... aM
   ```
   - \( N \): Total number of vertices (positive integer).
   - \( M \): Size of the array (non-negative integer).
   - \( a \): Space-separated integers representing the connections.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   3
   1 2 3
   ```

3. **Output**: The application will print the order of integers read as a space-separated string based on their connectivity.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   3 2 1
   ```

## Example

To see the application in action, you can use the following example:

1. Input:
   ```
   6
   4
   1 2 3 4
   ```

2. Output:
   ```
   4 3 2 1
   ```

This indicates that all integers from the connected component containing vertex 1 have been read in descending order.

## Conclusion

The Graph Reading Order Application is a powerful tool for processing integers based on their connectivity in a graph. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily run the application and obtain the desired reading order of integers.
