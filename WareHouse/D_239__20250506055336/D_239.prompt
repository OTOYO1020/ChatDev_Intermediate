Read integers A, B, C, and D from standard input. Initialize a list 'winning_moves' to store all possible sums of integers chosen by Takahashi and Aoki. Loop through all integers 't' from A to B (inclusive) for Takahashi's choices.\n   - For each 't', loop through all integers 'a' from C to D (inclusive) for Aoki's choices.\n   - Calculate the sum 's = t + a' and append it to 'winning_moves'. Create a function 'is_prime(n)' to check if a number 'n' is prime. Initialize counters for Aoki's wins and Takahashi's wins. Loop through each sum in 'winning_moves':\n   - If 'is_prime(s)', increment Aoki's win counter.\n   - Otherwise, increment Takahashi's win counter. Compare the win counters:\n   - If Aoki's wins > Takahashi's wins, Aoki is the winner.\n   - Otherwise, Takahashi is the winner. Print the winner's name based on the comparison.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output should be either Aoki or Takahashi depending on who wins the game.
