# Takahashi vs Aoki Game

Welcome to the Takahashi vs Aoki game application! This software allows you to simulate a game between two players, Takahashi and Aoki, where they compete based on the sums of their chosen integers.

## Main Functions

The application consists of the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter four integers (A, B, C, D) that define the ranges for Takahashi's and Aoki's choices.
2. **Winning Moves Calculation**: The application calculates all possible sums of integers chosen by Takahashi (from A to B) and Aoki (from C to D).
3. **Prime Checking**: A function checks if a number is prime, which determines the winner based on the sums calculated.
4. **Winner Determination**: The application compares the number of prime sums (Aoki's wins) against the non-prime sums (Takahashi's wins) to declare the winner.

## Installation Instructions

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: In this case, there are no additional dependencies required beyond Python itself.

## How to Use/Play the Game

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Integers**: When prompted, enter four integers separated by spaces. These integers represent:
   - A: The starting integer for Takahashi's choices.
   - B: The ending integer for Takahashi's choices.
   - C: The starting integer for Aoki's choices.
   - D: The ending integer for Aoki's choices.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter A, B, C, D separated by spaces: 1 5 1 5
   ```

3. **View the Result**: After entering the integers, the application will calculate the winning moves and determine the winner. The result will be printed to the console.

   Example output:
   ```
   The winner is: Aoki
   ```

## Conclusion

Thank you for using the Takahashi vs Aoki game application! We hope you enjoy playing and exploring the outcomes of different integer choices. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out.
