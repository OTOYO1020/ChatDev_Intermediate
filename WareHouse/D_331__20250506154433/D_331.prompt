Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the size of the pattern grid P. Initialize a 2D array 'P' of size N x N to store the color pattern, and read the values for 'P[i][j]' (either 'B' or 'W') from standard input. Read the integer Q from standard input, which represents the number of queries. For each query, read the integers A, B, C, and D from standard input, which define the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangular area. Calculate the number of black squares in the rectangular area defined by (A, B) and (C, D):\n   - Initialize a counter 'black_count' to zero.\n   - Loop through the rows from A to C and the columns from B to D.\n   - For each square (i, j), determine its color using 'P[i % N][j % N]'.\n   - If the color is 'B', increment 'black_count'. Store the result of 'black_count' for each query. After processing all queries, print the results for each query on a new line.\n\nThe function to handle the queries could be named 'count_black_squares(A, B, C, D)', which will be called within the loop for each query. The output format will be a list of integers representing the count of black squares for each query.
