# Color Grid Counting Application

This application allows users to create a grid of colors and perform queries to count the number of black squares ('B') within specified rectangular areas of the grid.

## Main Functions

- **Grid Initialization**: Users can define a grid of size N x N filled with colors 'B' (black) and 'W' (white).
- **Query Processing**: Users can input multiple queries to count the number of black squares in specified rectangular areas of the grid.
- **Input Validation**: The application includes validation for grid size and query parameters to ensure correct usage.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any additional libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, it is recommended to use Python 3.6 or higher.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Grid Size**:
   You will be prompted to enter the size of the grid (N). For example:
   ```
   Enter grid size (N): 3
   ```

3. **Input the Grid Colors**:
   Enter the colors for each cell in the grid in row-major order. Each row should contain exactly N colors separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter grid colors (B/W) for each cell in row-major order:
   B W B
   W B W
   B W B
   ```

4. **Input the Number of Queries**:
   Enter the number of queries (Q) you wish to perform. For example:
   ```
   Enter number of queries (Q): 2
   ```

5. **Input the Queries**:
   For each query, input the integers A, B, C, and D, which define the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangular area. For example:
   ```
   Enter query (A B C D): 1 1 3 3
   Enter query (A B C D): 2 2 3 3
   ```

6. **View Results**:
   After processing all queries, the application will output the count of black squares for each query on a new line. For example:
   ```
   5
   2
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```
Enter grid size (N): 3
Enter grid colors (B/W) for each cell in row-major order:
B W B
W B W
B W B
Enter number of queries (Q): 2
Enter query (A B C D): 1 1 3 3
Enter query (A B C D): 2 2 3 3
5
2
```

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple interface for managing a color grid and counting black squares based on user-defined queries. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the support team.
