Task:
Read the integer \( N \) from standard input, which represents the number of AtCoder users. Initialize two lists: 'usernames' to store the usernames \( S_i \) and 'ratings' to store the ratings \( C_i \). For each user from 1 to \( N \):\n   - Read the username \( S_i \) and rating \( C_i \) from standard input.\n   - Append \( S_i \) to 'usernames' and \( C_i \) to 'ratings'. Create a list of tuples 'user_data' where each tuple contains the username and its corresponding rating: 'user_data = list(zip(usernames, ratings))'. Sort 'user_data' lexicographically based on usernames. Calculate the total rating \( T \) by summing all elements in 'ratings'. Determine the winner's index using \( \text{winner\_index} = T \mod N \). Retrieve the winner's username from the sorted 'user_data' using the winner's index. Print the winner's username.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output should be the winner's username as a single line.
