Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of points in sets S and T. Initialize two lists, 'S' and 'T', to store the points from the input. For i from 1 to N:\n   - Read the coordinates (a_i, b_i) for set S and append them to the list 'S'.\n   - Read the coordinates (c_i, d_i) for set T and append them to the list 'T'. Define a function 'rotate_point(point, angle)' that takes a point and an angle, and returns the coordinates of the point after rotating it by the specified angle. Define a function 'translate_point(point, q, r)' that takes a point and translation values q and r, and returns the new coordinates of the point after translation. Create a function 'transform_and_compare(S, T)' that:\n   - Iterates through all possible angles (0 < p < 360) and applies the 'rotate_point' function to each point in S.\n   - For each rotated set, iterates through all possible translations (q, r) and applies the 'translate_point' function to each rotated point.\n   - Checks if the transformed points in S can match the points in T after sorting both sets. Call 'transform_and_compare(S, T)' to determine if it is possible to transform S to match T. Print YES if S can be transformed to match T, otherwise print NO.
