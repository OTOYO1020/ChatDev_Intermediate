# Point Transformation Application

Transform and compare sets of points through rotation and translation.

## Overview

The Point Transformation Application allows users to input two sets of points (S and T) and determine if it is possible to transform set S into set T through a series of rotations and translations. This application is useful in various fields such as computer graphics, robotics, and geometric computations.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Points**: Users can input coordinates for two sets of points (S and T).
2. **Transform Points**: The application rotates points in set S by various angles and translates them to see if they can match the points in set T.
3. **Comparison**: After transformations, the application checks if the transformed points in S can match the points in T and displays the result.

## Installation

To run the Point Transformation Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

   Note: `tkinter` is included with most Python installations, but if you encounter issues, ensure it is installed.

## How to Use the Application

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Number of Points**: When prompted, enter the integer N, which represents the number of points in sets S and T.

3. **Enter Coordinates for Set S**: For each point in set S, enter the coordinates in the format `x,y`. For example:

   ```
   Enter coordinates for point 1 in set S (format: x,y): 1,2
   ```

4. **Enter Coordinates for Set T**: Similarly, for each point in set T, enter the coordinates in the same format.

5. **View Results**: After entering all points, the application will output "YES" if set S can be transformed to match set T, or "NO" if it cannot.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `gui.py` is located. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

2. **Input Points for Set S**: In the GUI, enter the coordinates for set S in the format `x1,y1 x2,y2 ...` (space-separated).

3. **Input Points for Set T**: Enter the coordinates for set T in the same format.

4. **Transform and Compare**: Click the "Transform and Compare" button to initiate the transformation and comparison process.

5. **View Results**: A message box will display whether set S can be transformed to match set T.

## Conclusion

The Point Transformation Application is a powerful tool for transforming and comparing sets of points. Whether using the command-line interface or the graphical user interface, users can easily determine the relationship between two sets of points through rotation and translation.
