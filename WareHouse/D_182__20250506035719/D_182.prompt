Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of elements in the sequence. Read the sequence of integers A from standard input, which contains N elements (A_1, A_2, ..., A_N). Initialize a variable 'current_position' to 0 to track the robot's position on the number line. Initialize a variable 'max_position' to 0 to keep track of the greatest coordinate occupied by the robot. Loop through the sequence A from index 1 to N:\n   - For each index i, update 'current_position' by adding A[i-1] (since A is 0-indexed).\n   - Update 'max_position' to be the maximum of 'max_position' and 'current_position'. After completing the loop, the value of 'max_position' will represent the greatest coordinate occupied by the robot. Print the value of 'max_position' as the final output.
