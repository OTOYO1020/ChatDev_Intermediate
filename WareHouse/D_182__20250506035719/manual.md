# Robot Position Calculator

A simple application to calculate the maximum position occupied by a robot on a number line based on a sequence of movements.

## Main Functions

The Robot Position Calculator performs the following main functions:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user inputs a valid number of elements and a valid sequence of integers.
2. **Position Calculation**: Tracks the robot's current position on a number line and calculates the maximum position reached based on the provided movements.
3. **Output**: Displays the maximum position reached by the robot after processing the sequence of movements.

## Installation

To run the Robot Position Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

You can check your Python version by running:
```bash
python --version
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Number of Elements**: When prompted, enter a positive integer representing the number of elements in the sequence.

4. **Input the Sequence of Integers**: Enter the sequence of integers separated by spaces. Ensure that the number of integers matches the number you provided in the previous step.

5. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and display the maximum position reached by the robot.

### Example Usage

```
Enter the number of elements in the sequence: 5
Enter 5 integers separated by spaces: 1 -2 3 4 -1
```

**Output**:
```
Maximum position reached: 6
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-integer value for the number of elements, the application will prompt you to enter a valid integer.
- If the sequence does not match the expected length, an error message will be displayed, and you will be prompted to re-enter the sequence.
- If the input is empty or contains invalid integers, appropriate error messages will guide you to correct the input.

## Conclusion

The Robot Position Calculator is a straightforward tool for tracking movements on a number line. By following the instructions above, you can easily install and use the application to determine the maximum position reached by a robot based on a series of movements.
