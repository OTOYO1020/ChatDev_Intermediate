Read integers N and K from standard input. Initialize a list 'segments' to store the K non-intersecting segments. For each segment from 1 to K, read the values L_i and R_i and append the segment [L_i, R_i] to 'segments'. Construct a set 'S' that contains all integers from the union of the segments defined in 'segments'. Initialize a list 'ways' of size N+1 with all elements set to 0, and set 'ways[1] = 1' (starting position). Loop through each cell 'i' from 1 to N:\n   - For each integer 'd' in the set 'S', check if 'i + d' is within bounds (i.e., â‰¤ N).\n   - Update 'ways[i + d]' by adding 'ways[i]' to it, ensuring to take modulo 998244353. The result will be stored in 'ways[N]', which represents the number of ways to reach Cell N. Print the value of 'ways[N]' as the final output.
