Gomoku is a traditional board game that is played on a grid. The objective is to be the first player to get five of their pieces in a row. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board, and the game ends when one player wins or when the board is completely filled, resulting in a draw.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:**
   When you run the game, it will announce that a new game has started and that Player X goes first.

2. **Making a Move:**
   Players take turns entering the coordinates of the cell where they want to place their piece. The coordinates should be in the format `row column`, where both row and column are integers between 0 and 14 (inclusive).

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter row and column (0-14) separated by space: 7 7
   ```

   - Players alternate turns, with Player X starting first.
   - If a player tries to place a piece in an already occupied cell, they will be prompted to choose another cell.
   - The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player aligns five pieces in a row, they win the game.
   - If the board is completely filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

4. **Ending the Game:**
   When a player wins or if the game ends in a draw, the game will announce the result and reset for a new game.
