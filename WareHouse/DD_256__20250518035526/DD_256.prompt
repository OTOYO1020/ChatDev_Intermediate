Define a function 'union_intervals(N: int, intervals: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]' to handle the input where 'N' is the number of intervals and 'intervals' is a list of tuples representing the intervals '[L_i, R_i)'. Parse the input to extract the integer values of 'N' and the list of intervals '[(L_1, R_1), (L_2, R_2), ..., (L_N, R_N)]'. Sort the list of intervals based on the starting point 'L_i' of each interval. Initialize an empty list 'result' to store the merged intervals. Iterate through the sorted intervals and merge overlapping or contiguous intervals into the 'result' list. For each interval, check if it overlaps with the last interval in 'result'. If it does, update the end of the last interval in 'result'. If an interval does not overlap, append it to the 'result' list as a new interval. After processing all intervals, the 'result' list will contain the union of the intervals represented as the minimum number of right half-open intervals. Return the 'result' list from the function 'union_intervals'. Format the output as a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a tuple '(L, R)'.
