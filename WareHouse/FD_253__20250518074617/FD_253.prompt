Define a function 'process_queries(N: int, M: int, Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, ...]])' to handle the input parameters N, M, Q, and the list of queries. Initialize a matrix 'matrix' of size N x M filled with zeros. Iterate through each query in the 'queries' list. For queries of type '1 l r x', update the specified columns from l to r by adding x to each element in those columns. For queries of type '2 i x', replace all elements in the i-th row with the value x. For queries of type '3 i j', retrieve the value at the (i, j)-th position in the matrix and store it for output. Ensure that all indices are adjusted for 0-based indexing when accessing the matrix. Handle the constraints to ensure that the operations do not exceed the limits set by the problem statement. Collect all outputs from type '3' queries into a list. Return or print the collected outputs in the required format.
