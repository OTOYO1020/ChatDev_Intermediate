# Matrix Query Processor

A Python application for processing matrix queries efficiently.

## Overview

The Matrix Query Processor allows users to perform various operations on a 2D matrix, including updating columns, replacing rows, and retrieving specific values. This software is designed to handle a series of queries that manipulate the matrix based on user-defined instructions.

## Main Functions

The primary function of the software is `process_queries`, which takes the following parameters:

- **N**: Number of rows in the matrix.
- **M**: Number of columns in the matrix.
- **Q**: Number of queries to process.
- **queries**: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a query of one of the following types:
  - **Type 1**: `(1, l, r, x)` - Update columns from `l` to `r` by adding `x` to each element in those columns.
  - **Type 2**: `(2, i, x)` - Replace all elements in the `i-th` row with the value `x`.
  - **Type 3**: `(3, i, j)` - Retrieve the value at the `(i, j)` position in the matrix.

The function returns a list of outputs from all type '3' queries.

## Installation

To run the Matrix Query Processor, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any future dependencies here
   ```

   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Matrix Query Processor, follow these steps:

1. **Import the function**:
   In your Python script, import the `process_queries` function:
   ```python
   from main import process_queries
   ```

2. **Define your matrix dimensions and queries**:
   Set the values for `N`, `M`, and `Q`, and create a list of queries:
   ```python
   N = 3  # Number of rows
   M = 4  # Number of columns
   Q = 5  # Number of queries
   queries = [
       (1, 1, 2, 5),  # Update columns 1 to 2 by adding 5
       (2, 1, 10),    # Replace row 1 with 10
       (3, 1, 1),     # Get value at (1, 1)
       (1, 2, 4, 3),  # Update columns 2 to 4 by adding 3
       (3, 2, 3)      # Get value at (2, 3)
   ]
   ```

3. **Call the function**:
   Execute the `process_queries` function with the defined parameters:
   ```python
   results = process_queries(N, M, Q, queries)
   print(results)  # Output the results of type '3' queries
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to use the Matrix Query Processor:

```python
from main import process_queries

N = 3
M = 4
Q = 5
queries = [
    (1, 1, 2, 5),
    (2, 1, 10),
    (3, 1, 1),
    (1, 2, 4, 3),
    (3, 2, 3)
]

results = process_queries(N, M, Q, queries)
print(results)  # Output: [10, 3]
```

## Conclusion

The Matrix Query Processor is a powerful tool for efficiently managing and querying 2D matrices. With its simple interface and flexible query handling, it can be easily integrated into larger applications or used for standalone matrix operations.
