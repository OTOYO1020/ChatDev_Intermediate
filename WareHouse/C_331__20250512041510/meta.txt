Task:
Define a function named 'sum_greater_elements' that takes a list of integers 'A' as input. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the list 'A' from standard input. Ensure that the length of 'A' matches 'N' and raise an error if it does not. Iterate through each element 'A[i]' in the list 'A' using a loop. For each 'A[i]', calculate the sum of all elements in 'A' that are greater than 'A[i]'. Store the results of each sum in a list named 'results'. After processing all elements, return the 'results' list from the function. Implement output handling to print each value in the 'results' list on a new line. Ensure that the function handles the constraints of '1 ≤ N ≤ 200000' and '1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000000' efficiently. Test the function with various input cases to ensure correctness and performance.
