# Sum Greater Elements

A Python application to calculate the sum of all elements in a list that are greater than each element in the list.

## Main Functions

The `sum_greater_elements` application provides the following functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `A` from standard input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the length of the list `A` matches `N` and raises an error if it does not.
- **Calculation**: For each element `A[i]`, calculates the sum of all elements in `A` that are greater than `A[i]`.
- **Output Handling**: Prints each calculated sum on a new line.

## Installation

To run the `sum_greater_elements` application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application requires no external dependencies beyond the Python standard library. Ensure you have Python version 3.6 or higher.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the integer `N` followed by the list of integers `A`, all space-separated. For example:

   ```
   Enter N followed by the list of integers (space-separated): 5 1 2 3 4 5
   ```

   Here, `N` is `5`, and the list `A` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

4. **Output**: The application will print the sum of all elements greater than each element in the list `A`, each on a new line.

   For the input above, the output will be:

   ```
   14
   12
   9
   5
   0
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for input validation. If the input does not meet the requirements (e.g., the length of `A` does not match `N`), an error message will be displayed:

```
Input Error: The length of the list must match N.
```

## Testing

To ensure correctness and performance, you can test the function with various input cases. Consider edge cases such as:

- Minimum input values (e.g., `N = 1`, `A = [1]`)
- Maximum input values (e.g., `N = 200000`, `A` containing the maximum integer values)
- Randomized input values for performance testing.

## Conclusion

The `sum_greater_elements` application is designed to efficiently calculate the required sums while handling large inputs. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
