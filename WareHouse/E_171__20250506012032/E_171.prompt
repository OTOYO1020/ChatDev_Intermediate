Read the integer N from standard input, ensuring that N is even and within the range [2, 200000]. Read the array of integers 'a' of length N, where each element 'a[i]' (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) represents the xor calculated by Snuke Cat i. Calculate the total xor of all elements in the array 'a' and store it in a variable 'total_xor'. Initialize an empty array 'scarves' of length N to store the integers on the scarves of each Snuke Cat. For each Snuke Cat i (from 0 to N-1):\n   - Compute the integer on the scarf of Snuke Cat i as 'scarves[i] = total_xor xor a[i]'. Print the integers in the 'scarves' array, each on a new line.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to be implemented: 'restore_scarves(N, a)'\n- Variables: 'total_xor', 'scarves'
