# Snuke Cat Application

## Introduction

The Snuke Cat application is designed to help users calculate the integers on the scarves of each Snuke Cat based on the XOR values provided. This application reads an even integer N and an array of integers, computes the total XOR, and then determines the scarf values for each Snuke Cat.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the integer N is even and within the range [2, 200000]. Also validates the array of integers to ensure they meet specified criteria.
- **XOR Calculation**: Computes the total XOR of the input array and calculates the scarf values for each Snuke Cat using the formula `scarves[i] = total_xor XOR a[i]`.
- **Output**: Prints the calculated scarf values, each on a new line.

## Installation

To run the Snuke Cat application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application does not require any additional dependencies beyond Python itself. However, ensure you have a compatible version of Python (3.x recommended).

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Values**:
   - When prompted, enter an even integer N within the range [2, 200000].
   - Next, input the array of integers (space-separated) that represent the XOR values from each Snuke Cat.

4. **View the Results**: The application will calculate and print the integers on the scarves of each Snuke Cat, each on a new line.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter an even integer N (2-200000): 4
Enter the array of integers (space-separated): 1 2 3 4
```

Output:
```plaintext
4
5
6
7
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for invalid inputs:
- If N is not even or out of range, an error message will prompt you to enter a valid integer.
- If the array length does not match N or contains invalid integers, appropriate error messages will guide you to correct the input.

## Conclusion

The Snuke Cat application is a straightforward tool for calculating scarf values based on XOR inputs. With its user-friendly interface and robust input validation, it provides a reliable solution for users needing to perform these calculations.
