# Triangle Combination Calculator

Calculate the number of valid triangle combinations from given stick lengths.

## Overview

The Triangle Combination Calculator is a Python application designed to determine how many unique triangles can be formed from a set of stick lengths. It checks for valid combinations based on the triangle inequality theorem and ensures that all stick lengths used in a combination are distinct.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of sticks and their respective lengths from the user.
- **Validation**: Ensures that all input values are positive integers and that the correct number of lengths is provided.
- **Triangle Counting**: Iterates through all combinations of three distinct stick lengths and counts how many of those combinations can form a valid triangle.
- **Output**: Displays the total count of valid triangle combinations.

## Installation

To run the Triangle Combination Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable). For this application, there are no external dependencies, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can skip this step as the application only uses built-in libraries.)

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located, and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Input the Number of Sticks**: When prompted, enter a positive integer representing the number of sticks.

```
Enter the number of sticks (positive integer): 5
```

3. **Input the Stick Lengths**: Enter the lengths of the sticks as space-separated integers. Ensure that the number of lengths matches the number of sticks you entered previously.

```
Enter 5 positive stick lengths (space-separated): 3 4 5 6 7
```

4. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and display the number of valid triangle combinations that can be formed with the provided stick lengths.

```
Output: 10
```

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how the application works:

1. User inputs the number of sticks: `5`
2. User inputs the stick lengths: `3 4 5 6 7`
3. The application processes the input and outputs the count of valid triangles.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter a non-integer or a negative number for the number of sticks, the application will prompt you to enter a valid positive integer.
- **Length Mismatch**: If the number of lengths provided does not match the number of sticks, the application will notify you to enter the correct number of lengths.
- **Negative or Zero Lengths**: The application will reject any stick lengths that are zero or negative.

## Conclusion

The Triangle Combination Calculator is a straightforward tool for determining valid triangle combinations from stick lengths. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily calculate the number of triangles that can be formed with their given stick lengths.
