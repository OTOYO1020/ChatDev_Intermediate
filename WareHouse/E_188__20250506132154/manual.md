# Gold Profit Calculator

A Python application to calculate the maximum profit from buying and selling gold across multiple towns connected by roads.

## Main Functions

The Gold Profit Calculator provides the following functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of towns and roads, as well as the price of gold in each town.
- **Graph Representation**: Utilizes an adjacency list to represent the roads between towns.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores all reachable towns from each town to determine the maximum selling price of gold.
- **Profit Calculation**: Computes the profit for each town by subtracting the buying price from the maximum reachable selling price.
- **Maximum Profit Output**: Returns and prints the maximum profit encountered during the calculations.

## Quick Install

To run the Gold Profit Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt` file:

```
# requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain two integers, N (number of towns) and M (number of roads).
   - The second line should contain N integers representing the price of gold in each town.
   - The next M lines should each contain two integers, X_i and Y_i, representing a directed road from Town X_i to Town Y_i.

   Example input:
   ```
   4 4
   10 20 30 40
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   1 4
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Output**: The application will print the maximum profit that can be achieved based on the provided input.

## Example

Given the following input:
```
4 4
10 20 30 40
1 2
2 3
3 4
1 4
```

The output will be:
```
30
```
This indicates that the maximum profit achievable is 30.

## Error Handling

If there are any issues with the input (e.g., out-of-range town indices), the application will print an error message to the standard error output.

## Conclusion

The Gold Profit Calculator is a powerful tool for analyzing potential profits from gold trading across interconnected towns. By leveraging graph theory and search algorithms, it provides insights into the best trading strategies.
