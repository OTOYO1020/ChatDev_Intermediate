Read the integer N and the string S from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'result' to store characters that will remain after processing. Initialize a counter 'open_parentheses' to track the number of unmatched opening parentheses. Iterate through each character in the string S:\n   - If the character is '(', increment 'open_parentheses'.\n   - If the character is ')', check if there is an unmatched '(':\n     - If 'open_parentheses' is greater than 0, decrement 'open_parentheses' and skip adding this ')' to 'result'.\n     - If 'open_parentheses' is 0, add ')' to 'result' (this means it's unmatched).\n   - If the character is a lowercase letter, add it to 'result'. After processing all characters, construct the final string from the 'result' list. Print the final string, which contains the characters that remain after all possible operations.
