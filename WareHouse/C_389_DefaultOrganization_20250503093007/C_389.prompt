Read the integer Q from standard input, which represents the number of queries. Initialize an empty list 'queue' to represent the queue of snakes and a variable 'head_position' to track the head position of the last snake added. Loop through the range of Q to process each query:\n   - For a query of type '1 l':\n     - Append the length 'l' to the 'queue'.\n     - If the 'queue' was empty, set 'head_position' to '0'. Otherwise, update 'head_position' to the sum of the last snake's head position and its length.\n   - For a query of type '2':\n     - Remove the first snake from the 'queue'.\n     - Get the length 'm' of the removed snake.\n     - Decrease the head position of all remaining snakes in the 'queue' by 'm'.\n   - For a query of type '3 k':\n     - Output the head coordinate of the snake that is 'k'-th from the front of the 'queue'. Ensure that the input is processed in the order given and that the constraints are adhered to for each query type. Print the results for all type '3' queries in the order they were processed.
