Task:
Define a function 'maxIlluminatedBuildings(N: int, H: List[int]) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for calculating the maximum number of buildings that can be illuminated. Parse the input to extract the integer values for N and the list of heights H from the input format. Implement a loop to iterate through each unique height in the list H to consider it for illumination. For each unique height, create a list of indices of buildings that have that height. Check the indices list to find the maximum number of buildings that can be selected at equal intervals. Utilize a nested loop to check for all possible intervals between selected buildings and count valid selections. Keep track of the maximum count of buildings that can be illuminated for each height. Return the maximum count found after checking all heights. Ensure that the function handles edge cases such as when N is 1 or when all buildings have different heights. Output the result in the format of a single integer representing the maximum number of buildings that can be illuminated.
