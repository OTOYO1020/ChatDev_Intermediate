# Illumination Application

Calculate the maximum number of buildings that can be illuminated based on their heights.

## Overview

The Illumination Application provides a function to determine how many buildings can be illuminated based on their heights. The application takes the number of buildings and their respective heights as input and calculates the maximum number of buildings that can be illuminated at equal intervals.

## Main Functions

- **maxIlluminatedBuildings(N: int, H: List[int]) -> int**: This function encapsulates the logic for calculating the maximum number of illuminated buildings. It iterates through unique heights, checks indices of buildings with those heights, and counts how many can be illuminated at equal intervals.

## Installation

To run the Illumination Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

   Note: The `typing` module is included in Python 3.5 and later, so you may not need to install it separately if you are using a compatible version.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Use the following command to run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the number of buildings (N) followed by the heights of the buildings as a comma-separated list. For example:

   ```
   Enter number of buildings (N): 5
   Enter heights of buildings (comma-separated): 3, 1, 2, 3, 2
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will process the input and output the maximum number of illuminated buildings. For example:

   ```
   Maximum illuminated buildings: 3
   ```

## Edge Cases

- If there is only one building (N = 1), the function will return 1, as that building can be illuminated.
- If all buildings have different heights, the function will evaluate each height and return the maximum count based on the intervals.

## Conclusion

The Illumination Application is a straightforward tool for calculating illuminated buildings based on their heights. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily determine the maximum number of buildings that can be illuminated at equal intervals.
