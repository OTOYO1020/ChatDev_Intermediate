# Gomoku Game

A simple and engaging Gomoku game implemented in Python, allowing players to compete against each other on a 15x15 board.

## Quick Install

To run the Gomoku game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can clone the repository or download the source code files. Make sure you have the following files:

- `main.py`
- `gomoku_game.py`

You do not need any additional dependencies for this basic version of the game.

## üéÆ What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a traditional board game where two players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a grid. The objective is to be the first player to get five of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## üìñ How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Instructions**:
   - Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 15x15 board.
   - Enter your move as two integers representing the row and column (0-14).
   - The first player to get 5 in a row wins the game.

3. **Making a Move**:
   - When prompted, enter the row and column numbers for your move.
   - Example: To place your mark in the first row and first column, enter `0 0`.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game will check for a winner after each move.
   - If a player wins, the game will display the winner and ask if you want to play again.

5. **Restarting or Exiting**:
   - If you want to play again after a game ends, enter `y` when prompted.
   - To exit the game, enter `n`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure
