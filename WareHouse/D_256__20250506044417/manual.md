# Interval Merger

A simple application for merging overlapping intervals using Python.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a series of right half-open intervals and merges any overlapping intervals. The result is a list of merged intervals, displayed in a specified format. 

## Main Functions

1. **Read Intervals**: 
   - Reads the number of intervals and their respective pairs (L_i, R_i) from standard input.
   - Validates the input to ensure that L_i is less than R_i.

2. **Merge Intervals**: 
   - Merges overlapping intervals based on the sorted order of their starting points.
   - If intervals overlap, it combines them into a single interval.

3. **Display Merged Intervals**: 
   - Outputs the number of merged intervals and their respective ranges in the format `[L, R)`.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# Currently, there are no external dependencies required for this application.
```

You can install any future dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**:
   - First, enter an integer N, which represents the number of intervals.
   - Then, for each interval, input the starting and ending points separated by a comma (e.g., `1,5`).

   Example Input:
   ```
   3
   1,3
   2,4
   5,7
   ```

4. **Output**:
   The application will output the number of merged intervals followed by each merged interval in the format `[L, R)`.

   Example Output:
   ```
   2
   [1, 4)
   [5, 7)
   ```

## Example

To illustrate how the application works, consider the following example:

### Input:
```
4
1,3
2,6
8,10
15,18
```

### Output:
```
3
[1, 6)
[8, 10)
[15, 18)
```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to merge overlapping intervals. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
