Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of stages. Initialize two lists, 'A' and 'B', to store the time required to clear each stage using the two available actions. Read the next N-1 integers into list 'A', representing the time to clear stage i and move to stage i+1. Read the next N-1 integers into list 'B', representing the time to clear stage i and move to stage X_i. Read the next N-1 integers into list 'X', representing the stage that can be accessed after clearing stage i using action B. Initialize a list 'min_time' of size N+1 with infinity to store the minimum time required to reach each stage, setting 'min_time[1]' to 0 (starting stage). Loop through each stage i from 1 to N-1:\n   - Update 'min_time[i+1]' with the minimum of its current value and 'min_time[i] + A[i]' (time to clear stage i and move to stage i+1).\n   - Update 'min_time[X[i]]' with the minimum of its current value and 'min_time[i] + B[i]' (time to clear stage i and move to stage X_i). The minimum time to reach stage N will be stored in 'min_time[N]'. Print the value of 'min_time[N]' as the output, which represents the minimum seconds required to reach stage N.
