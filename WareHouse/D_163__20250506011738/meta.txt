Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input. Initialize a set to store unique sums of chosen integers. Generate the list of integers from \(10^{100}\) to \(10^{100} + N\). Use combinations to select subsets of the generated integers with size \(K\) or more. For each selected subset, calculate the sum of the integers. Store the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\) in the set of unique sums. Repeat the process for all possible sizes from \(K\) to \(N + 1\). Count the number of unique sums stored in the set. Print the count of unique sums as the final output.
