# Takahashi Reachability Checker

A Python application to determine if Takahashi can reach a specific coordinate after a given number of jumps.

## Main Functions

The Takahashi Reachability Checker consists of two main components:

1. **canReachCoordinate(N: int, jumps: List[Tuple[int, int]], X: int) -> bool**: 
   - This function checks if Takahashi can reach the target coordinate `X` after `N` jumps, given a list of jump options.
   - It utilizes a set to track all unique positions Takahashi can reach after each jump.

2. **Main Application**:
   - The main application gathers user input, processes it, and outputs whether the target coordinate is reachable or not.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Reachability Checker, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (you can add more libraries as needed):

```
# Required dependencies for the Takahashi Reachability Checker
```

Then, install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Run the Application

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Input Data

You will be prompted to enter the following data:

1. **Number of Jumps (N)**: Enter an integer representing how many jumps Takahashi can make.
2. **Jumps**: Enter the jump options in the format `a1,b1 a2,b2 ...` where each `a_i` and `b_i` represents the jump distances.
3. **Target Coordinate (X)**: Enter the target coordinate you want to check if Takahashi can reach.

### Example Input

```
Number of Jumps (N): 3
Jumps (format: a1,b1 a2,b2 ...): 1,2 2,1 3,4
Target Coordinate (X): 5
```

### Step 3: Output

The application will output either "Yes" or "No" based on whether the target coordinate `X` is reachable after `N` jumps.

## Edge Cases

- If `N` is 0 or negative, the application will output "No".
- If the jumps input is empty or does not match the number of jumps specified, the application will handle these cases gracefully and output appropriate messages.

## Conclusion

The Takahashi Reachability Checker is a simple yet effective tool for determining reachability based on specified jump distances. Feel free to modify the code or add additional features as needed for your specific use cases.
