Define a function 'canReachCoordinate(N: int, jumps: List[Tuple[int, int]], X: int) -> bool' to check if Takahashi can reach coordinate X after N jumps. Parse the input to extract the integer N, a list of tuples for jumps containing (a_i, b_i), and the target coordinate X. Implement a loop to iterate through each jump from 1 to N and calculate all possible positions Takahashi can reach after each jump using a set to store unique positions. For each jump, update the set of reachable positions by adding both a_i and b_i to each position in the current set of reachable positions. After processing all jumps, check if coordinate X is in the set of reachable positions. Return True if X is reachable, otherwise return False. Handle edge cases where N is 0 or jumps are not provided, returning False in such cases. Ensure that all input values are validated according to the given constraints before processing. Write test cases to verify the correctness of the function with various inputs, including edge cases. Output the result as 'Yes' if True and 'No' if False based on the function's return value.
