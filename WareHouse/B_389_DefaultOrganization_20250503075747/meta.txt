Task:
Read the integer X from standard input, ensuring that it is not less than 2. Initialize a variable 'N' to 1 to start calculating factorials. Initialize a variable 'factorial' to 1 to hold the value of N!. Use a loop to calculate factorials:\n   - While 'factorial' is less than X:\n     - Increment 'N' by 1.\n     - Update 'factorial' as 'factorial *= N'. After exiting the loop, 'N' should be the positive integer such that 'N! = X'. Print the value of 'N'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the integer N whose factorial equals the given X, while adhering to the constraints provided.
