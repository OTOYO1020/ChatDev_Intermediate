# Factorial Calculator

A simple application to find the smallest integer N such that N! (N factorial) equals a given integer X.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer from the user, ensuring it is at least 2.
- **Factorial Calculation**: It calculates the factorial of integers starting from 1 until it finds the smallest N such that N! equals X.
- **Output**: The application prints the value of N or indicates if no such N exists.

## Installation

To run the Factorial Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input an Integer**: When prompted, enter an integer greater than or equal to 2.
   ```
   Enter an integer (>= 2):
   ```

4. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and display the smallest integer N such that N! = X, or inform you if no such N exists.

## Example Usage

- **Input**: 
  ```
  Enter an integer (>= 2): 6
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  The smallest N such that N! = 6 is: 3
  ```

## Error Handling

- If the input is less than 2 or not an integer, the application will display an error message:
  ```
  Input Error: Please enter an integer greater than or equal to 2.
  ```

## Conclusion

This Factorial Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating factorials and finding the corresponding integer N. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, adhering to the constraints provided.
