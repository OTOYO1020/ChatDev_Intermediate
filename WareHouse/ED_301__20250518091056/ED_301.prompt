Define the function 'canReachGoal(H: int, W: int, T: int, grid: List[List[str]]) -> Tuple[bool, int]' to handle the input parameters, where H is the number of rows, W is the number of columns, T is the maximum number of moves, and grid is a 2D list representing the grid. Parse the input to extract H, W, T, and the grid representation from the given input format. Identify the coordinates of the start square 'S' and the goal square 'G' within the grid. Collect the coordinates of all candy squares 'o' in the grid, ensuring that the count does not exceed 18. Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the start square 'S' to the goal square 'G', while keeping track of the number of moves made and the candy squares visited. During the BFS, ensure that movements are only made to adjacent non-wall squares (i.e., squares represented by '.', 'o', or 'G'). Check if the goal square 'G' can be reached within T moves during the BFS traversal. If the goal is reachable, calculate the maximum number of unique candy squares that can be visited on the path to 'G'. Return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the goal is reachable and the maximum number of candy squares visited. Format the output according to the specified output format, indicating whether reaching the goal is possible and the maximum number of candies collected.
