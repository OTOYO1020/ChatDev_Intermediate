# Graph Path Weight Calculator

This application calculates the minimum possible path weight between vertices in a graph based on user-defined edges and sequences. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding and evaluates all permutations of a sequence to find the minimum sum of path weights.

## Main Functions

1. **Graph Representation**: The application allows users to define a graph with a specified number of vertices and edges.
2. **Path Weight Calculation**: Using Dijkstra's algorithm, the application computes the minimum path weight between any two vertices.
3. **Permutation Evaluation**: The application generates all permutations of a sequence and calculates the total path weight for each permutation, returning the minimum sum.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here, e.g., heapq is part of the standard library
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input Data**: The application reads input data from standard input. The expected format is as follows:
   - The first line contains two integers, N (number of vertices) and M (number of edges).
   - The next M lines each contain three integers: u (start vertex), v (end vertex), and w (weight of the edge).
   - The next line contains an integer K (length of sequences).
   - The following line contains K integers for sequence A.
   - The last line contains K integers for sequence B.

   Example input:
   ```
   5 6
   1 2 10
   1 3 5
   2 3 2
   2 4 1
   3 4 2
   4 5 3
   3
   1 2 4
   3 4 5
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the application using the command line:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```
   Replace `input.txt` with the path to your input file containing the formatted data.

3. **View Output**: The application will print the minimum sum of path weights based on the permutations of sequence B.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various scenarios, such as:
- Invalid vertex indices.
- Insufficient edges or sequences provided.
- No valid paths found for the given sequences.

If an error occurs, a descriptive message will be printed to the console.

## Future Enhancements

This application is designed to be extensible. Future enhancements may include:
- Support for directed graphs.
- Additional graph algorithms (e.g., A* or Bellman-Ford).
- User interface improvements for easier input handling.
