Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph. Initialize a list of edges to store tuples of (u_i, v_i, w_i) for each edge. For each edge (from 1 to M), read the vertices u_i and v_i, and the weight w_i, then store them in the edges list. Read integer K from standard input, representing the length of the sequences. Initialize two lists A and B to store the sequences of length K. Read K integers into list A and K integers into list B from standard input. Implement a function 'f(x, y)' that calculates the minimum possible path weight between vertices x and y using a suitable graph traversal algorithm (e.g., modified Dijkstra's algorithm). Generate all permutations of list B and compute the sum of 'f(A[i], B[i])' for each permutation. Track the minimum sum obtained from all permutations of B. Print the minimum sum as the final output.
