# Score Calculation Application

This application is designed to calculate the maximum score based on non-decreasing sequences and a set of queries. It allows users to input parameters and queries, generating all possible sequences to find the optimal score.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers N (length of sequences), M (maximum value in sequences), and Q (number of queries) from standard input.
- **Sequence Generation**: Generates all possible non-decreasing sequences of length N with values ranging from 1 to M.
- **Query Processing**: Evaluates a list of queries against each generated sequence to calculate scores based on specified conditions.
- **Score Calculation**: Determines the maximum score across all sequences based on the provided queries.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application requires no external libraries beyond the Python standard library. However, if you want to run it in a virtual environment, you can use the following commands:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install any additional dependencies** (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain three integers: `N`, `M`, and `Q`.
   - The next `Q` lines should each contain four integers: `a_i`, `b_i`, `c_i`, and `d_i`.

   Example input:
   ```
   3 5 2
   1 2 1 10
   2 3 2 20
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file from the command line:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Provide Input**: You can either type the input directly into the console or redirect input from a file:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will print the maximum score calculated based on the input sequences and queries.

## Example Usage

Given the following input:
```
3 5 2
1 2 1 10
2 3 2 20
```
The application will generate all non-decreasing sequences of length 3 with values between 1 and 5, evaluate the queries, and output the maximum score.

## Conclusion

This application provides a robust solution for calculating scores based on non-decreasing sequences and queries. It is designed for ease of use and flexibility, allowing users to input various parameters and queries to obtain results quickly.
