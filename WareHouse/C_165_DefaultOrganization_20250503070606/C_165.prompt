Read the integers N, M, Q from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'queries' to store the quadruples (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i). For each of the Q queries, read the quadruple (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i) and append it to the 'queries' list. Generate all possible non-decreasing sequences 'A' of length N with values between 1 and M. For each sequence 'A', initialize a variable 'score' to 0. For each query (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i) in 'queries', check if the condition 'A[b_i] - A[a_i] == c_i' holds:\n   - If true, add d_i to 'score'. Keep track of the maximum score encountered across all sequences. After evaluating all sequences, store the maximum score found. Print the maximum score as the output.
