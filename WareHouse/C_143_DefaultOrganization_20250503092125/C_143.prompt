Read the integer N and the string S from standard input. Initialize a counter 'slime_count' to 0. Set a variable 'previous_color' to an empty string to track the color of the last slime. Iterate through each character in the string S:\n   - For each character (color) in S:\n     - If the current color is different from 'previous_color', increment 'slime_count' by 1.\n     - Update 'previous_color' to the current color. After the loop, 'slime_count' will represent the total number of distinct slimes after fusion. Print the value of 'slime_count' as the final output.
