# Slime Counter

A simple application to count distinct slimes based on their colors after fusion.

## Overview

The Slime Counter application reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from standard input, where `N` represents the number of slimes and `S` is a string of characters representing the colors of these slimes. The application counts how many distinct slimes remain after fusion based on the color changes in the string.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer and a string from the user.
- **Distinct Slime Counting**: Counts the number of distinct slimes based on color changes in the string.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

## Installation

To run the Slime Counter application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries, but you should have Python 3.x installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the Slime Counter application.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main Python file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Requirements**:
   - First, enter a positive integer `N` (the number of slimes).
   - Next, enter a string `S` of length `N` consisting of characters representing the colors of the slimes.

   Example Input:
   ```
   5
   RRGGB
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will output the count of distinct slimes after fusion.

   Example Output:
   ```
   3
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- If `N` is not a positive integer, it will prompt: `Input Error: N must be a positive integer.`
- If the length of `S` does not match `N`, it will prompt: `Input Error: Length of S must be equal to N.`
- If `S` is an empty string, it will prompt: `Input Error: S cannot be an empty string.`

## Conclusion

The Slime Counter application is a straightforward tool for counting distinct slimes based on their colors. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear error messages to guide users through the input process.
