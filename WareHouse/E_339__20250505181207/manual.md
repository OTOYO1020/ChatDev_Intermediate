# Longest Valid Subsequence Finder

This application allows users to find the longest valid subsequence from a given sequence of integers based on specified constraints. The valid subsequence is defined by the absolute difference between consecutive elements being less than or equal to a specified integer D.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads integers N (length of the sequence) and D (the maximum allowed difference) from the user.
- **Validation**: It validates the input to ensure that N is a positive integer and that the sequence contains exactly N elements.
- **Subsequence Calculation**: It calculates the length of the longest valid subsequence based on the defined criteria.
- **Output**: The application outputs the length of the longest valid subsequence.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Values**:
   - When prompted, enter the integer N (the number of elements in the sequence).
   - Enter the integer D (the maximum allowed difference between consecutive elements).
   - Finally, input the sequence of integers as space-separated values.

4. **View Results**: After entering the required inputs, the application will process the data and output the length of the longest valid subsequence.

### Example Usage

```
Enter N: 5
Enter D: 2
Enter Sequence (space-separated): 1 2 3 5 8
The longest valid subsequence length is: 3
```

In this example, the longest valid subsequence is `[1, 2, 3]`, which has a length of 3.

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-positive integer for N, the application will notify you that the input is invalid.
- If the sequence length does not match N, the application will prompt you to check your input.
- If the sequence contains invalid values (non-integers or empty strings), the application will indicate that the input is invalid.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to find the longest valid subsequence based on user-defined constraints. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, ensuring that users can quickly obtain the results they need.
