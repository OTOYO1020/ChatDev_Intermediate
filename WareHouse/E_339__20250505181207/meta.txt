Task:
Read the integer N and the integer D from standard input. Read the sequence A of length N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'max_length' to 0 to keep track of the maximum length of the valid subsequence. Initialize a variable 'current_length' to 1 to count the length of the current valid subsequence. Loop through the sequence A from the second element to the last:\n   - For each element A[i], check if the absolute difference between A[i] and A[i-1] is less than or equal to D.\n     - If true, increment 'current_length'.\n     - If false, compare 'current_length' with 'max_length' and update 'max_length' if necessary, then reset 'current_length' to 1. After the loop, perform a final check to update 'max_length' with the last counted 'current_length'. Print the value of 'max_length' as the result.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid subsequence while adhering to the constraints provided.
