# Dish Selector

A simple application to determine the minimum number of dishes that can be eaten without exceeding sweetness and saltiness thresholds.

## Main Functions

The Dish Selector application provides the following main functions:

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of dishes, sweetness threshold, saltiness threshold, and lists of sweetness and saltiness values from standard input.
- **Dish Selection**: Calculates the minimum number of dishes that can be consumed without exceeding the specified thresholds.
- **Output**: Displays the minimum number of dishes that can be eaten.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment for the Dish Selector application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The application does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain an integer `N`, the number of dishes.
   - The second line should contain an integer `X`, the sweetness threshold.
   - The third line should contain an integer `Y`, the saltiness threshold.
   - The fourth line should contain a comma-separated list of integers representing the sweetness values of the dishes.
   - The fifth line should contain a comma-separated list of integers representing the saltiness values of the dishes.

   Example input:
   ```
   5
   10
   15
   2,3,5,1,4
   3,2,4,1,5
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application from the command line. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Output**: After providing the input, the application will process the data and output the minimum number of dishes that can be eaten without exceeding the thresholds. The output will be displayed in the format:
   ```
   Minimum Dishes Eaten: <number>
   ```

## Edge Cases

- If no dishes can be eaten without exceeding the thresholds, the application will return `0`.
- Ensure that the lengths of the sweetness and saltiness lists match the number of dishes `N` to avoid input errors.

## Testing

To validate the correctness and performance of the application, you can test it with various input scenarios, especially with upper limit constraints. Consider edge cases such as:
- All dishes exceeding the thresholds.
- Dishes with zero sweetness or saltiness.
- Large lists of dishes to test performance.

## Conclusion

The Dish Selector application is a straightforward tool for determining the optimal number of dishes to consume based on sweetness and saltiness thresholds. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and run the application to meet their needs.
