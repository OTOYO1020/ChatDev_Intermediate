Define the function 'min_dishes(N: int, X: int, Y: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of dishes, X is the sweetness threshold, Y is the saltiness threshold, A is the list of sweetness values, and B is the list of saltiness values. Parse the input to extract the values of N, X, Y, A, and B from the standard input format. Implement a sorting mechanism to arrange the dishes based on their sweetness and saltiness values, possibly using a combined metric or heuristic to determine the optimal order. Initialize variables to keep track of the total sweetness and total saltiness consumed, as well as a counter for the number of dishes eaten. Iterate through the arranged list of dishes, updating the total sweetness and total saltiness with each dish consumed until one of the thresholds (X or Y) is exceeded. Check after each addition if the total sweetness exceeds X or if the total saltiness exceeds Y, and break the loop if either condition is met. Return the count of dishes eaten as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when no dishes can be eaten without exceeding the thresholds. Test the function with various input scenarios to validate correctness and performance, especially with upper limit constraints. Format the output to return the minimum number of dishes eaten as an integer.
