Read the integer T from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, read the integers N, X, and K from standard input. Construct the tree structure based on the given rules:\n   - For each vertex i (from 2 to N), create an edge connecting vertex i to vertex ⌊i/2⌋. Determine the distance from vertex X to all other vertices in the tree. Count the number of vertices that are exactly K edges away from vertex X. Store the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, prepare the results for output. Print the results for each test case on a new line.\n\nNote: Given the constraints, especially with N being as large as 10^18, the tree structure should be conceptualized rather than explicitly constructed. The distance calculation should leverage the properties of the binary tree structure without needing to store all vertices.
