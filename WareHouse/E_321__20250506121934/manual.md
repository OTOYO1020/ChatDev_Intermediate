# Tree Distance Calculator

A Python application for calculating the number of vertices at a specific distance in a conceptual binary tree structure.

## Overview

The Tree Distance Calculator allows users to determine how many vertices are exactly K edges away from a specified vertex X in a binary tree constructed from integers 1 to N. The tree is conceptualized based on the rule that each vertex i (from 2 to N) connects to vertex ⌊i/2⌋. This application is designed to handle large values of N (up to 10^18) without explicitly constructing the tree.

## Main Functions

- **count_vertices_at_distance(N, X, K)**: This function calculates the number of vertices that are exactly K edges away from vertex X in a conceptual tree with N vertices.
- **calculate_depth(N)**: Computes the maximum depth of the tree based on N.
- **calculate_distance_to_root(X)**: Determines the distance from vertex X to the root of the tree.

## Installation

To run the Tree Distance Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You can install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If there are no specific dependencies listed, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   The application reads input from standard input. You can run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input format**:
   - The first line should contain an integer T, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, provide three integers N, X, and K on a new line, separated by spaces.

   Example input:
   ```
   2
   7 3 2
   10 5 1
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The application will output the count of vertices exactly K edges away from vertex X for each test case, each on a new line.

   Example output for the above input:
   ```
   2
   2
   ```

## Example

To test the application, you can use the following example:

```bash
echo -e "1\n10 5 2" | python main.py
```

This command will simulate input for one test case where N=10, X=5, and K=2.

## Additional Information

For more details on the implementation, refer to the source code in `tree_distance_calculator.py`. This module contains the logic for calculating distances and counting vertices in the conceptual tree.
