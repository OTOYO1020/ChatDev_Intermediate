# Unique Sums Counter

A Python application to calculate the number of unique sums from a generated list of integers.

## Overview

The Unique Sums Counter is designed to help users compute the number of unique sums that can be formed by choosing K or more integers from a specified range. The integers are generated starting from \(10^{100}\) up to \(10^{100} + N\). This application is useful for mathematical computations involving large integers and combinatorial sums.

## Main Functions

- **count_possible_sums(N: int, K: int) -> int**: This function calculates the number of unique sums that can be formed by choosing K or more integers from the generated list. It handles edge cases and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Installation

To run the Unique Sums Counter, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip.

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If there are no specific dependencies listed, you can skip this step.*

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the program.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the values for N and K. 
   - **N**: The range limit for generating integers.
   - **K**: The minimum number of integers to choose.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter N: 10
   Enter K: 2
   ```

4. **View Results**: The application will compute and display the count of unique sums.

   Example output:
   ```
   Unique sums count: 55
   ```

## Edge Cases

- If K is greater than N, or if either N or K is negative, the function will return 0, indicating that no combinations are possible.
- Ensure that the inputs are valid integers to avoid errors.

## Conclusion

The Unique Sums Counter provides a straightforward way to compute unique sums from a large range of integers. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily set up and run the application to meet their computational needs.
