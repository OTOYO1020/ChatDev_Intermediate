Task:
Define a function 'count_possible_sums(N: int, K: int) -> int' to handle the main logic of the problem. Implement input handling to read integers N and K from standard input. Generate the list of integers from '10^100' to '10^100 + N'. Calculate the number of ways to choose K or more integers from the generated list. Compute the possible sums of the chosen integers. Use a set to store unique sums to avoid duplicates. Apply modulo operation with '(10^9 + 7)' on the final count of unique sums. Return the count of unique sums as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when K equals 1 or N. Format the output to display the result as an integer.
