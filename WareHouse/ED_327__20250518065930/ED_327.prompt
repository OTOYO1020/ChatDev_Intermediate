Define the function 'max_rating(N: int, P: List[int]) -> float' to calculate the maximum possible rating based on the number of contests and their performances. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list of performances P from standard input. Ensure that the list P contains exactly N integers, each representing the performance in a contest. Create a loop to iterate through all possible subsets of contests, ensuring at least one contest is chosen. For each subset of contests, calculate the rating R using the provided formula, ensuring to maintain the order of contests. Store the maximum rating found during the iterations of the subsets. Implement a helper function to calculate the rating R given a specific subset of performances. Ensure that the calculation of R handles the division and square root correctly to avoid any mathematical errors. Return the maximum rating found as a float value from the 'max_rating' function. Format the output to display the maximum rating with appropriate precision.
