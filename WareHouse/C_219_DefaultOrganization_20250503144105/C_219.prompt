Read the permutation string 'X' from standard input, which represents the new alphabetical order of lowercase English letters. Read the integer 'N' from standard input, which indicates the number of citizens. Initialize an empty list 'names' to store the names of the citizens. For each citizen from 1 to N, read the name 'S_i' from standard input and append it to the 'names' list. Create a mapping 'order_map' that associates each character in 'X' with its index (0 to 25) to facilitate sorting based on the new order. Define a custom sorting function 'custom_sort(name)' that converts each character in 'name' to its corresponding index using 'order_map'. Sort the 'names' list using the 'custom_sort' function to determine the lexicographical order according to the new alphabetical order. Prepare to output the sorted names. Print each name in the sorted 'names' list, one per line. Ensure that the output format is correct, with each name appearing on a new line.
