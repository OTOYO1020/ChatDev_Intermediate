Task:
Receive the integer N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to keep track of valid pairs (i, j). Loop through all integers i from 1 to N:\n   - For each i, loop through all integers j from 1 to N:\n     - Check if the product 'i * j' is a perfect square. To check if a number is a perfect square, compute the integer square root of 'i * j' and verify if squaring it returns the original product. If 'i * j' is a perfect square, increment the 'count' by 1. After both loops, print the final value of 'count'.\n\nThis approach ensures that we check all pairs (i, j) within the given constraints and count those that meet the specified condition.
