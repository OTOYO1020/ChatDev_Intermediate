# Perfect Square Counter

A simple application to count valid pairs (i, j) where the product i * j is a perfect square.

## Main Functions

The Perfect Square Counter application consists of two main components:

1. **User Input**: The application prompts the user to enter a positive integer N.
2. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The application calculates the number of valid pairs (i, j) such that the product i * j is a perfect square and displays the result.

## Installation

To run the Perfect Square Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The application does not have any external dependencies beyond the standard library.

### Step 1: Install Python

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the application files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perfect-square-counter.git
cd perfect-square-counter
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

You can run the application directly using Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Then execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Start the Application**: Run the `main.py` file as described above.
2. **Enter a Positive Integer**: When prompted, enter a positive integer N (greater than 0). The application will validate the input.
3. **View the Result**: After entering a valid integer, the application will calculate and display the number of valid pairs (i, j) where the product i * j is a perfect square.

### Example Usage

```
Enter a positive integer N (greater than 0): 5
Number of valid pairs: 9
```

In this example, the user entered 5, and the application calculated that there are 9 valid pairs (i, j) for the given N.

## Error Handling

If the user enters an invalid input (e.g., a negative number or a non-integer), the application will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid positive integer.

```
Input Error: N must be a positive integer. Please enter a positive integer greater than 0.
```

## Conclusion

The Perfect Square Counter application is a straightforward tool for counting pairs of integers whose product is a perfect square. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear instructions for input and error handling.
