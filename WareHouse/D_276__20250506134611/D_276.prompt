Read the integer N from standard input, followed by the sequence of positive integers A of length N. Initialize a variable 'total_operations' to 0 to keep track of the total number of operations performed. Create a function 'reduce_value(value)' that takes an integer 'value' and returns the number of operations needed to reduce it to the smallest possible value that is not divisible by 2 or 3. For each integer 'a_i' in the array A:\n   - Call 'reduce_value(a_i)' and accumulate the result into 'total_operations'. Check if all values in A can be reduced to the same minimum value:\n   - If they can, print 'total_operations'.\n   - If they cannot, print '-1'. Ensure that the function handles edge cases where values cannot be reduced to a common value. Implement input validation to ensure that all integers in A are within the specified range. Optimize the 'reduce_value' function to minimize the number of operations performed. Test the implementation with various sequences of integers to ensure correctness. Print the final result based on the checks performed.
