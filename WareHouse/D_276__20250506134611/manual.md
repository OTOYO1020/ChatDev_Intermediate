# Integer Reduction Program

This application allows users to reduce a sequence of positive integers to the smallest possible values that are not divisible by 2 or 3. It calculates the total number of operations required to achieve this and checks if all values can be reduced to the same minimum value.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer N and a sequence of N positive integers from standard input.
- **Reduction Logic**: Implements the `reduce_value(value)` function to determine the number of operations needed to reduce a given integer.
- **Operation Calculation**: Accumulates the total number of operations for all integers in the sequence.
- **Validation**: Ensures all integers are positive and checks if they can be reduced to a common value.
- **Output**: Displays the total operations or indicates if reduction to a common value is not possible.

## Installation

To run the Integer Reduction Program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This program does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the `main.py` and `operations.py` files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts in the terminal:
   - Enter the number of integers (N).
   - Enter the integers separated by spaces.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the number of integers: 5
   Enter integers separated by spaces: 12 18 24 30 36
   ```

4. **View Results**: The program will output the total number of operations required or indicate if it is not possible to reduce all integers to a common value.

   Example output:
   ```
   Total operations: 10
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the program works:

- Input:
  ```
  Enter the number of integers: 3
  Enter integers separated by spaces: 10 15 20
  ```

- Output:
  ```
  Total operations: 6
  ```

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:
- If N is not a positive integer, it prompts the user to enter a valid number.
- If the number of integers provided does not match N, it alerts the user.
- If any input integer is not positive, it returns an error message.

## Testing

To ensure correctness, the implementation has been tested with various sequences of integers. You can add more test cases by modifying the input directly in the terminal or by creating a separate test script.

## Conclusion

This Integer Reduction Program is a simple yet effective tool for reducing integers based on specific divisibility rules. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
