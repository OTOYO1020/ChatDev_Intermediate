# Count Possible Strings

A Python application to count the possible strings derived from a given string based on marked characters, ensuring that no two marked characters are adjacent.

## Main Functions

- **count_possible_strings(S: str, marked_chars: set) -> int**: This function encapsulates the logic for counting the valid combinations of marked characters in the input string `S`. It returns the count of valid strings modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Quick Install

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip. 

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.*

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: 
   - Navigate to the directory where your `main.py` file is located.
   - Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Handling**:
   - You will be prompted to enter a string `S` (length between 1 and 200,000 characters).
   - After entering the string, you will be asked to input the marked characters (e.g., 'ab').

3. **Output**:
   - The application will calculate and display the number of possible strings derived from `S` based on the marked characters provided.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter a string (1-200,000 characters): abacabadabacaba
Enter marked characters (e.g., 'ab'): ab
Possible strings: 21
```

## Edge Cases

- The application validates the length of the input string `S`. If the length is not between 1 and 200,000 characters, an error message will be displayed.
- The function handles cases where there are no marked characters, returning 0 in such scenarios.

## Testing

The function has been optimized to handle the upper limit of string length efficiently. You can test the function with various edge cases, including:

- Minimum length string (e.g., "a")
- Maximum length string (e.g., a string of 200,000 characters)
- Strings with no marked characters
- Strings with all characters marked

## Conclusion

This application provides a robust solution for counting possible strings derived from a given string based on specified marked characters. It is designed to be efficient and user-friendly, making it suitable for various applications in string manipulation and combinatorial counting.
