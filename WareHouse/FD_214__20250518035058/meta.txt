Task:
Define a function 'count_possible_strings(S: str) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting the possible strings T derived from S. Implement input handling to read the string S from standard input. Validate the length of S to ensure it is between 1 and 200,000 characters. Create a method to identify all possible combinations of marked characters in S such that no two marked characters are adjacent. Count the valid combinations of marked characters that can form the string T. Implement a modulo operation to return the count of valid strings T modulo (10^9 + 7). Ensure that the order of characters in S is preserved when forming T. Test the function with various edge cases, including the minimum and maximum lengths of S. Optimize the algorithm to handle the upper limit of S efficiently. Output the final count of possible strings T as an integer.
