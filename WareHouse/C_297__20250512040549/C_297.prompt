Define the function 'max_pcs(H: int, W: int, S: List[str]) -> List[str]' to accept the number of strings H, the length of each string W, and the list of strings S. Parse the input to extract the integers H and W, and the list of strings S. Initialize a result list to store the modified strings after performing the operations. Iterate through each string S[i] in the list S. For each string S[i], check for occurrences of 'TT' and replace them with 'PC' while counting the number of replacements made. Update the string S[i] in the result list with the modified version after all possible replacements. Ensure that the replacements do not overlap by adjusting the index appropriately after each replacement. Return the modified list of strings as the output of the function. Handle edge cases where no replacements can be made and ensure the original strings are returned. Format the output as a list of strings representing the final state of each string after all operations.
