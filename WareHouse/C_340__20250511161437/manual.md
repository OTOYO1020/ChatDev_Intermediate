Once Python is installed, you can clone the repository or download the files directly. Make sure you have the following files in your project directory:

- `main.py`
- `gomoku_game.py`

## ü§î What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a traditional board game played with black and white stones on a grid. The objective is to be the first player to get five of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

   ```

2. **Game Instructions**:

   - Players take turns entering their moves.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to align five of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
   - If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
