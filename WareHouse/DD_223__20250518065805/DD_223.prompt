Define the function 'find_lexicographically_smallest_permutation(N: int, M: int, constraints: List[Tuple[int, int]])' to handle the input format where 'N' is the size of the permutation, 'M' is the number of constraints, and 'constraints' is a list of tuples representing the pairs '(A_i, B_i).' Initialize a directed graph to represent the constraints, where each node corresponds to an integer from 1 to N. For each constraint '(A_i, B_i)' in the input, add a directed edge from 'A_i' to 'B_i' in the graph. Perform a topological sort on the directed graph to determine if a valid ordering exists that satisfies all constraints. If the topological sort fails (i.e., a cycle is detected), return '-1' as output. If the topological sort is successful, construct the lexicographically smallest permutation from the sorted order. Ensure that the final permutation contains all integers from 1 to N without repetition. Return the resulting permutation as a list of integers. Handle edge cases, such as when M is 0, by returning the sorted list of integers from 1 to N. Output the final permutation in the required format, ensuring it is printed as space-separated integers.
