Define the function 'remaining_apples(N: int, A: List[int], K: int) -> List[int]' to calculate the remaining apples in each basket. Parse the input to extract the integer values for N, the list A of integers representing apples in each basket, and the integer K. Initialize a variable 'eaten' to 0 to keep track of the number of apples eaten by Takahashi. Use a loop to iterate over the baskets starting from basket 1, and for each basket, check if it contains apples. If the current basket contains apples, decrement the count of apples in that basket and increment the 'eaten' variable by 1. Continue moving to the next basket in a circular manner until 'eaten' equals K. Ensure that the loop wraps around correctly when reaching the end of the basket list. After exiting the loop, prepare the output list containing the remaining apples in each basket. Return the output list from the function. Output the result in the specified format as a list of integers representing the remaining apples in each basket.
