# Distinct Integers Counter with Blackout Functionality

This software allows users to count distinct integers in a grid while applying a blackout area, effectively ignoring the integers within that area. It is designed for ease of use and flexibility in handling various grid sizes and blackout dimensions.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The software prompts users for grid dimensions, blackout dimensions, and the grid itself.
- **Distinct Integer Counting**: The core functionality iterates through the grid, counting distinct integers that are not within the specified blackout area.
- **Error Handling**: The software includes robust error handling to ensure that user inputs are valid and conform to specified constraints.

## Installation Instructions

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   The software does not have external dependencies beyond the standard library. Ensure you have `typing` available, which is included in Python 3.5 and later.

## How to Use the Software

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Required Values**:
   The application will prompt you to enter the following values:
   - **Height (H)**: The total height of the grid.
   - **Width (W)**: The total width of the grid.
   - **Number of Rows (N)**: The number of rows in the grid (should match H).
   - **Grid (A)**: Enter each row of the grid as space-separated integers.
   - **Blackout Height (h)**: The height of the blackout area.
   - **Blackout Width (w)**: The width of the blackout area.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter Height (H): 4
   Enter Width (W): 4
   Enter Number of Rows (N): 4
   Enter Row 1 (space-separated integers): 1 2 3 4
   Enter Row 2 (space-separated integers): 5 6 7 8
   Enter Row 3 (space-separated integers): 9 10 11 12
   Enter Row 4 (space-separated integers): 13 14 15 16
   Enter Blackout Height (h): 2
   Enter Blackout Width (w): 2
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   After entering all the required inputs, the application will process the grid and display the results, which is a list of counts of distinct integers for each blackout position.

   Example output:
   ```
   Results: [12, 12, 12, 12]
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- Invalid input types (non-integer values).
- Mismatched grid dimensions.
- Blackout dimensions exceeding grid dimensions.
- Non-positive integers for height, width, and blackout dimensions.

If an error occurs, the application will display an appropriate message.

## Conclusion

This software provides a straightforward way to count distinct integers in a grid while applying blackout areas. It is flexible and can handle various grid sizes and blackout configurations. For any further assistance or feature requests, please contact our support team.
