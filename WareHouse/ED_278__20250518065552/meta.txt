Task:
Define the function signature as 'def count_distinct_integers(H: int, W: int, N: int, A: List[List[int]], h: int, w: int) -> List[int]:' Parse the input values for H, W, N, h, w, and the grid A from the input format. Initialize an empty list 'results' to store the count of distinct integers for each blackout position. Iterate over all possible top-left corners '(k, l)' of the blackout area where '0 <= k <= H-h' and '0 <= l <= W-w'. For each '(k, l)', create a set to track distinct integers that are not blacked out. Iterate through the grid and add integers from 'A[i][j]' to the set if '(i, j)' is not within the blackout area defined by '(k, l)', 'h', and 'w'. After processing the grid for each '(k, l)', append the size of the set (count of distinct integers) to 'results'. Return the 'results' list containing counts of distinct integers for each blackout position. Ensure that all input values are validated to be within the specified constraints. Output the results in the specified format as a list of integers.
