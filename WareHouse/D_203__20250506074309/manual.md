# Pond Median Calculator

A tool for calculating the minimum median from K x K sections of a grid representing heights.

## Overview

The Pond Median Calculator allows users to input a grid of heights and determine the minimum median value from all possible K x K sections within the grid. This can be useful for various applications, such as environmental studies, urban planning, or any scenario where analyzing spatial data is required.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Grid Dimensions**: The user is prompted to enter the dimensions of the grid (N) and the size of the pond (K).
2. **Populate Grid**: The user inputs the heights for each cell in the N x N grid.
3. **Calculate Minimum Median**: The software processes all possible K x K sections of the grid and computes the minimum median value.
4. **Output Result**: The minimum median value is displayed to the user.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the environment for the Pond Median Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pond-median-calculator
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Since there are currently no external dependencies, you can simply ensure you have Python installed. If you plan to use libraries like NumPy or Pandas in the future, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file.

   To install any future dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Software

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Grid Size and Pond Size**:
   When prompted, enter the values for N (grid size) and K (pond size) as space-separated integers. For example:
   ```
   Enter N (grid size) and K (pond size): 4 2
   ```

3. **Input the Grid Values**:
   After entering the dimensions, you will be prompted to input the grid values. Enter N lines of space-separated integers representing the heights. For example:
   ```
   Enter grid values (space-separated):
   1 2 3 4
   5 6 7 8
   9 10 11 12
   13 14 15 16
   ```

4. **View the Result**:
   The application will process the input and display the minimum median value:
   ```
   Minimum Median: 6.0
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to ensure that:
- N is a positive integer.
- K is between 1 and N.
- The grid dimensions match the specified N.

If any input is invalid, an error message will be displayed.

## Future Enhancements

- Consider integrating libraries like NumPy for optimized numerical operations.
- Implement additional features for data visualization or exporting results.
