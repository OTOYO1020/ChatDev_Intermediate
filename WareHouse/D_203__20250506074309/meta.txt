Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input, representing the dimensions of the grid and the size of the pond. Initialize a 2D array 'A' of size N x N to store the heights of the squares. Populate the array 'A' by reading N lines of input, each containing N integers representing the heights. Initialize a variable 'min_median' to a large value to keep track of the minimum median found. Iterate over all possible top-left corners '(i, j)' of the K x K sections within the N x N grid:\n   - For each '(i, j)', extract the K x K section from the array 'A'. Sort the heights of the squares in the K x K section to find the median:\n   - Calculate the index for the median as 'median_index = (K * K) // 2'.\n   - Retrieve the median value from the sorted heights. Compare the median value with 'min_median' and update 'min_median' if the current median is lower. After checking all possible sections, store the final value of 'min_median'. Print the value of 'min_median' as the result. Ensure that all input values are integers and within the specified constraints.
