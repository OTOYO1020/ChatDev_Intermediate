Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, ensuring that it falls within the range of 3 to 100. Initialize a list 'dice_rolls' to store the results of each roll. For i from 1 to N, read two integers D_{i,1} and D_{i,2} from standard input and append them as a tuple (D_{i,1}, D_{i,2}) to 'dice_rolls'. Initialize a counter 'doublet_count' to zero to track consecutive doublets. Loop through the 'dice_rolls' list from index 0 to N-3 (inclusive):\n   - Check if the current roll and the next two rolls are doublets (i.e., D_{i,1} = D_{i,2}, D_{i+1,1} = D_{i+1,2}, D_{i+2,1} = D_{i+2,2}).\n   - If true, increment 'doublet_count' by 1. After the loop, check if 'doublet_count' is greater than or equal to 1. If 'doublet_count' is greater than or equal to 1, set the result to 'YES'; otherwise, set it to 'NO'. Print the result.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that all necessary steps are covered to implement the solution for the problem statement provided.
