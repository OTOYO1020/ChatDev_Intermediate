# Character Replacement Program

A simple Python application that allows users to replace characters in a given string based on specified operations.

## Main Functions

The Character Replacement Program performs the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads integer values for the length of the string (N) and the number of replacement operations (Q).
2. **String Modification**: Accepts a string of length N and a list of Q character pairs (c_i, d_i) to replace occurrences of character c_i with character d_i in the string.
3. **Output**: Displays the modified string after all replacements have been applied.

## Installation

To run the Character Replacement Program, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The program does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Program

1. **Run the Program**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: The program expects input in the following format:
   - First line: Two integers N (length of string) and Q (number of operations).
   - Second line: A string S of length N.
   - Next Q lines: Each containing a pair of characters (c_i, d_i) for replacement.

   Example Input:
   ```
   5 2
   hello
   h e
   o a
   ```

3. **Output**: After entering the input, the program will process the replacements and print the modified string. For the above example, the output would be:
   ```
   eall
   ```

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:
- If N is not a positive integer or Q is a negative integer, an error message will be displayed.
- If the length of the string S does not match N, an error message will be displayed.
- If the characters provided for replacement are not single characters, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Character Replacement Program is a straightforward tool for performing character replacements in strings. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear error messages to guide users in case of incorrect input.
