# Graph Painting Application

This application allows users to solve a graph painting problem where vertices of a graph can be painted in two colors (red and blue) based on specific conditions. The main goal is to count the valid ways to paint the vertices such that the number of edges connecting differently colored vertices is even.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of vertices (N), the number of edges (M), and the edges themselves from standard input.
- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list, which efficiently stores the edges.
- **Combination Generation**: The application generates all combinations of vertices to select exactly K vertices to paint red.
- **Edge Counting**: For each combination of red vertices, the application counts the edges connecting red and blue vertices.
- **Even Edge Condition**: It checks if the count of edges connecting differently colored vertices is even and increments the valid ways counter accordingly.
- **Output**: Finally, the application prints the total count of valid ways modulo 998244353.

## Installation Instructions

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: You can install the required dependencies using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install itertools
   ```

   Note: The `itertools` module is part of the Python standard library, so you typically don't need to install it separately.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - The first line contains two integers, N (number of vertices) and M (number of edges).
   - The second line contains an integer K (number of vertices to paint red).
   - The next M lines each contain two integers U_i and V_i representing the edges of the graph.

   Example input:
   ```
   5 6
   2
   1 2
   1 3
   2 4
   3 4
   4 5
   2 5
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application from the command line. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Provide Input**: After running the command, provide the input as described above. You can either type it directly into the terminal or redirect input from a file.

4. **View Output**: The application will output the total count of valid ways to paint the vertices based on the provided input.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to run the application with input redirection from a file:

1. Create a text file named `input.txt` with the following content:
   ```
   5 6
   2
   1 2
   1 3
   2 4
   3 4
   4 5
   2 5
   ```

2. Run the application with input redirection:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

3. The output will display the number of valid ways to paint the vertices.

## Conclusion

This Graph Painting Application provides a robust solution for counting valid vertex colorings in a graph based on specified conditions. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily set up and run the application to solve their graph painting problems.
