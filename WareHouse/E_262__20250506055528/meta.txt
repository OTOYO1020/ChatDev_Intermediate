Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input, followed by M pairs of integers (U_i, V_i) representing the edges of the graph. Store the edges in a suitable data structure, such as a list of tuples or an adjacency list. Initialize a variable 'count_ways' to store the number of valid ways to paint the vertices. Iterate over all combinations of N vertices to select exactly K vertices to paint red. For each combination of red vertices, count the number of edges connecting red and blue vertices. Check if the count of edges connecting different colors is even. If the conditions are satisfied, increment 'count_ways' by 1. After checking all combinations, compute 'count_ways' modulo 998244353. Print the final value of 'count_ways'.\n\nNote: The implementation of step 4 may require optimization techniques, such as dynamic programming or combinatorial counting, to handle the constraints efficiently.
