Task:
Define the function 'process_queries(N: int, A: List[int], Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int, Optional[int]]])' to handle the input parameters. Initialize the list 'A' with the given distinct integers. Iterate through each query in 'queries' and determine its type (either type 1 or type 2). For type 1 queries, find the index of element 'x' in 'A', and insert 'y' immediately after 'x' using 'A.insert(index + 1, y)'. For type 2 queries, find the index of element 'x' in 'A', and remove it using 'A.pop(index)'. Ensure that after each query, the list 'A' remains non-empty and contains distinct elements. After processing all queries, prepare to output the final state of list 'A'. Convert the final list 'A' into a string format suitable for output. Return or print the final output of the list 'A'. Handle input and output formatting as specified in the problem statement.
