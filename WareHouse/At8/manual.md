## Quick Install

To install the LangChain software, you can use either pip or conda package manager.

Using pip:
```
pip install langchain
```

Using conda:
```
conda install langchain -c conda-forge
```

## Introduction

LangChain is a software library that allows you to build applications using large language models (LLMs) through composability. It enables developers to combine LLMs with other sources of computation or knowledge, unlocking the full potential of these models.

## Main Functions

LangChain provides the following main functions:

1. **Question Answering over specific documents**: This function allows you to perform question answering over specific documents. You can provide a document or a set of documents, and LangChain will use LLMs to find the answers to your questions within the documents.

2. **Agents**: LangChain enables you to create intelligent agents by combining LLMs with other external services or APIs. You can build agents that can perform complex tasks by leveraging the power of LLMs and external resources.

## Installation

To use LangChain, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can install the LangChain library by running the following command:

```
pip install langchain
```

Alternatively, you can use the conda package manager to install LangChain:

```
conda install langchain -c conda-forge
```
