# Character Replacement Tool

A simple command-line application for replacing characters in a string based on user-defined operations.

## Overview

This tool allows users to read an integer value for the length of a string and the number of character replacement operations they wish to perform. It then modifies the string by replacing specified characters according to the provided operations.

## Main Functions

- **Read Input**: Accepts the length of the string (N), the number of operations (Q), the string itself (S), and pairs of characters to replace.
- **Character Replacement**: For each operation, replaces all occurrences of a specified character with another character in the string.
- **Output**: Displays the modified string after all operations have been applied.

## Installation

To run the Character Replacement Tool, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Verify Installation**: Open your command line interface (CLI) and run:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   This should display the installed version of Python.

3. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the following:
   - First line: Two integers, N (length of the string) and Q (number of operations), separated by a space.
   - Second line: The string S of length N.
   - Next Q lines: Each containing a pair of characters (c_i, d_i) to specify the replacement operation.

   Example input:
   ```
   5 2
   hello
   h y
   o a
   ```

3. **Output**: After entering the inputs, the modified string will be printed to the console.

## Example

### Input
```
5 2
hello
h y
o a
```

### Output
```
yella
```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:
- If N is not a positive integer or Q is negative, an error message will be displayed.
- If the length of string S does not match N, an error message will be displayed.
- If the character pairs do not consist of exactly one character each, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

This Character Replacement Tool is a straightforward command-line application that efficiently modifies strings based on user-defined character replacement operations. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
