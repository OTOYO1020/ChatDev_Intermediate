Read the integer values N and Q from standard input. Read the string S of length N from standard input. Initialize a list to store Q pairs of characters (c_i, d_i) for the operations. For each operation from 1 to Q:\n   - Read the pair of characters (c_i, d_i) and store them in the list. For each operation in the list of pairs:\n   - Replace all occurrences of character c_i in string S with character d_i. After all operations are completed, the final string S will be modified. Print the modified string S as the output.
