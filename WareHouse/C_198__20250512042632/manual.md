# Takahashi Step Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum number of steps Takahashi needs to reach a destination point (X, Y) from the origin (0, 0) using a specified step size (R).

## Main Functions

- **Calculate Minimum Steps**: The core function of the application calculates the minimum number of steps required for Takahashi to reach the destination point based on the Euclidean distance and the step size.
  
- **Input Validation**: The application ensures that the inputs for step size (R) and destination coordinates (X, Y) are valid and within specified ranges.

- **User-Friendly Output**: The application provides clear output messages, including error messages for invalid inputs and confirmation of the number of steps required.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Step Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application requires the `math` module, which is included in Python's standard library, so no additional installations are necessary.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the application files are located and run the main application file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the following values:
   - **Step Size (R)**: A positive integer representing the step size.
   - **Destination X**: An integer representing the X coordinate of the destination (must be between -10^9 and 10^9).
   - **Destination Y**: An integer representing the Y coordinate of the destination (must be between -10^9 and 10^9).

3. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the minimum number of steps required for Takahashi to reach the destination. If the destination is the origin (0, 0), it will inform you that no steps are needed.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter Step Size (R, positive integer): 5
Enter Destination X (between -10^9 and 10^9): 3
Enter Destination Y (between -10^9 and 10^9): 4
Minimum Steps: 1
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the step size (R) is not a positive integer, an error message will be displayed.
- If the destination coordinates (X, Y) are outside the specified range, an error message will be displayed.
- If non-integer values are entered, the application will prompt the user to enter valid integers.

## Conclusion

The Takahashi Step Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating the minimum steps required to reach a destination. With its user-friendly interface and robust input validation, it is designed to provide accurate results efficiently. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
