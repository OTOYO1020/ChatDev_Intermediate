Read the integer \( N \) from standard input, ensuring it is within the range of \(-10^{18}\) to \(10^{18}\) (inclusive). Calculate \( x \) using the formula \( x = N \mod 998244353 \). Ensure that \( x \) is non-negative and falls within the range of \( 0 \) to \( 998244353 - 1 \) (inclusive). Since it is guaranteed that such an integer \( x \) is unique, no further checks are necessary. Print the value of \( x \) as the output.
