# Grid Painter

A simple application for painting a grid with different colors based on user-defined operations.

## Overview

The Grid Painter allows users to initialize a grid of specified dimensions and perform painting operations on rows and columns. Users can track the number of cells painted with each color, making it a useful tool for visualizing grid-based color operations.

## Main Functions

- **Initialize Grid**: Create a grid of size H x W with all cells initially painted with color 0.
- **Paint Row**: Repaint all cells in a specified row with a chosen color.
- **Paint Column**: Repaint all cells in a specified column with a chosen color.
- **Count Colors**: Retrieve a count of how many cells are painted with each color after performing operations.

## Installation

To run the Grid Painter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If there is no `requirements.txt`, you can run the application without additional dependencies as it only requires Python's standard library.*

## How to Use the Application

### Running the Application

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the application files are located.
2. Run the main application file:

   - Enter the row number (0 to H-1) in the "Row" entry field.
   - Enter the color (integer) in the "Color" entry field.
   - Click the "Paint Row" button to apply the color to the specified row.

2. **Paint Column**:
   - Enter the column number (0 to W-1) in the "Column" entry field.

   - Click the "Paint Column" button to apply the color to the specified column.

3. **Count Colors**:
   - Click the "Count Colors" button to display the count of cells painted with each color in the label below.

### Example Operations

- To paint the first row (row 0) with color 1, enter `0` in the "Row" field and `1` in the "Color" field, then click "Paint Row".
- To paint the second column (column 1) with color 2, enter `1` in the "Column" field and `2` in the "Color" field, then click "Paint Column".
- Click "Count Colors" to see how many cells are painted with each color.
