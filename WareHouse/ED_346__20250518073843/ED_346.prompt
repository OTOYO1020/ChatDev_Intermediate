Define the function 'paint_grid(H: int, W: int, M: int, operations: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Dict[int, int]' to handle the input parameters. Initialize a grid of size H x W with all cells painted with color 0. Iterate through each operation in the list of operations. For each operation, check the type T_i: if T_i == 1, repaint all cells in the A_i-th row with color X_i. If T_i == 2, repaint all cells in the A_i-th column with color X_i. Use a dictionary to keep track of the count of cells painted with each color. After processing all operations, iterate through the grid to count the number of cells for each color. Store the counts in the dictionary where the key is the color and the value is the count of cells. Return the dictionary containing the counts of each color from the function. Ensure the output format is a dictionary where keys are colors and values are the number of cells painted with that color.
