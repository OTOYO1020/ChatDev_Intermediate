Task:
Define the function 'minimum_actions(N: int, L: List[int], U: List[int], Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input values for N, L, U, Q, and queries from the standard input format. Initialize a grid representation of the cells based on the given sequences L and U, marking empty cells and wall cells accordingly. Implement a method to determine the connectivity of empty cells using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) approach. For each query, extract the starting cell '(s_x, s_y)' and target cell '(t_x, t_y)' from the queries list. Calculate the minimum number of actions required to move from the starting cell to the target cell using the previously established connectivity. Store the results of each query in a list to be returned after processing all queries. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when the starting and target cells are the same. Return the list of results as the output of the function in the specified format. Output the results for each query in the required format after calling the function.
