# String Matcher

A simple yet powerful tool to determine if one string can be matched within another.

## Overview

The String Matcher software provides a function to check if a string `T` can be placed within another string `S` at any position. This is useful for applications that require pattern matching or string manipulation.

## Main Functions

- **can_match(S: str, T: str) -> bool**: This function checks if string `T` can be placed in string `S` at any position. It returns `True` if a match is found and `False` otherwise.

## Installation

To run the String Matcher, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the String Matcher code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/string-matcher.git
cd string-matcher
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

There are no external dependencies required for this software. It runs on standard Python libraries. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
2. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. You will be prompted to enter two strings, `S` and `T`.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter String S: hello world
Enter String T: world
```

Output:

```plaintext
YES
```

### Edge Cases

- If `T` is longer than `S`, the function will return `NO`.
- If `T` has a length of 1, it will check for the presence of that single character in `S`.

## Conclusion

The String Matcher is a straightforward tool for string matching tasks. It can be easily integrated into larger applications or used as a standalone utility. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
