Task:
Define the function 'can_match(S: str, T: str) -> bool' that takes two strings S and T as input. Implement input handling to read the strings S and T from standard input, ensuring S has length N and T has length M. Initialize a string X of length N consisting only of the character '#'. Iterate through all possible starting positions in X where T can be placed (from index 0 to N-M). For each starting position, replace M consecutive characters in X with T and check if X matches S. If a match is found, return True; otherwise, continue checking other positions. If no positions yield a match after all checks, return False. Ensure that the function handles edge cases where M is 1 or T is longer than S. Optimize the solution to handle the upper limits of N efficiently, considering the constraints. Output the result of the function as 'YES' if a match is possible and 'NO' otherwise.
