Read the integer N from standard input, ensuring it is within the range of 1 to 333. Initialize a list 'repunits' to store repunit numbers. Generate repunits by concatenating the digit '1' up to a reasonable limit (e.g., 333 repunits). Initialize a set 'sums' to store unique sums of three repunits. Use three nested loops to iterate through the 'repunits' list, calculating the sum of every combination of three repunits. Add each unique sum to the 'sums' set. Convert the 'sums' set to a sorted list 'sorted_sums'. Retrieve the N-th smallest sum from 'sorted_sums'. Print the N-th smallest sum as the output.\n\nOutput format: The output will be a single integer representing the N-th smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of exactly three repunits.
