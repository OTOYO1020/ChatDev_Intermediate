Task:
Read the input strings 'S' and 'T' from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'correct_positions' to store the indices of correctly typed characters. Initialize a variable 'j' to 0 to track the index of the string 'S'. Loop through each character in string 'T' using index 'i':\n   - If 'j' is less than the length of 'S' and the character at 'T[i]' matches 'S[j]', then:\n     - Append the index 'i' to 'correct_positions'.\n     - Increment 'j' by 1 to move to the next character in 'S'. After the loop, 'correct_positions' will contain all indices of correctly typed characters in 'T'. Print the contents of 'correct_positions' as a space-separated string.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that we accurately identify and record the positions of correctly typed characters in the string 'T' based on the intended string 'S'.
