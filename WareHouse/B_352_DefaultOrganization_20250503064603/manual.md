# Character Matching Application

This application is designed to help users identify the positions of correctly typed characters in a given string based on an intended string. It reads two input strings, compares them, and outputs the indices of the characters in the typed string that match the intended string.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter two strings, S (the intended string) and T (the typed string).
- **Character Matching**: It compares the characters of the two strings and identifies the positions of correctly typed characters.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes checks for empty inputs, ensures that both inputs are strings, and verifies that the typed string is long enough to contain the intended string.
- **Output**: The application outputs the indices of correctly typed characters as a space-separated string and provides warnings if not all characters from the intended string were matched.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries, so you can run it with just the standard Python installation. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. If you have the code in a single file, ensure you have `main.py` available.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Strings**: The application will prompt you to enter the intended string S and the typed string T. Follow the prompts:

   ```
   Please enter the intended string S: <your intended string>
   Please enter the typed string T: <your typed string>
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the strings, the application will display the positions of correctly typed characters in T. If there are any errors (e.g., empty strings, T being shorter than S), the application will provide appropriate error messages.

5. **Repeat or Exit**: The application will continue to prompt for input until valid strings are provided. Once processed successfully, the application will exit.

## Example Usage

```
Please enter the intended string S: hello
Please enter the typed string T: helo
Correctly typed character positions: 0 1
Warning: Not all characters from S were matched in T. Only 2 out of 5 characters were found.
```

## Conclusion

This application serves as a simple yet effective tool for identifying character matches between two strings. It is user-friendly and provides clear feedback on the input and results. For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the code comments or reach out to the development team.
