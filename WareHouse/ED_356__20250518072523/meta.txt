Task:
Define a function named 'calculate_sum' that takes an integer 'N' and a list of integers 'A' as parameters. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the sequence 'A' from standard input. Ensure that the length of the list 'A' is equal to 'N'. Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to store the cumulative sum. Use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs '(i, j)' where '1 <= i < j <= N'. For each pair '(i, j)', calculate 'max_value = max(A[i-1], A[j-1])' and 'min_value = min(A[i-1], A[j-1])'. Compute the floor division result 'floor_value = max_value // min_value'. Add 'floor_value' to 'total_sum'. Return the value of 'total_sum' as the output of the function. Print the output of the function after calling it with the provided inputs.
