# Sum Calculator

A simple application to calculate the cumulative sum based on pairs of integers in a given list.

## Introduction

The Sum Calculator application allows users to input a list of integers and computes a cumulative sum based on specific pairwise calculations. The application ensures that the input list length matches the specified number of elements and handles potential input errors gracefully.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the number of elements (N) and the list of integers (A). It validates the input to ensure that all elements are integers and that the length of A is equal to N.
  
- **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The core functionality of the application is encapsulated in the `calculate_sum` function, which iterates through all pairs of integers in the list, computes the maximum and minimum values, and calculates the floor division result. The cumulative sum of these results is returned.

- **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios, providing informative messages to the user.

## Installation

To run the Sum Calculator application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

There are no external dependencies required for this application. It runs on standard Python libraries.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the Sum Calculator application.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main Python file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of elements (N) and the list of integers (A). For example:

   ```
   Enter the number of elements (N): 5
   Enter the list of integers (space-separated): 10 5 2 1 20
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will compute the cumulative sum and display the result. For example:

   ```
   Result: 12
   ```

5. **Error Handling**: If you enter invalid data (e.g., non-integer values or mismatched lengths), the application will provide appropriate error messages.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Sum Calculator:

```plaintext
Enter the number of elements (N): 4
Enter the list of integers (space-separated): 8 4 2 1
Result: 6
```

In this example, the application calculates the cumulative sum based on the pairs of integers provided.

## Conclusion

The Sum Calculator is a straightforward tool for performing cumulative sum calculations based on user-defined integer lists. It is designed to be user-friendly and robust against common input errors. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
