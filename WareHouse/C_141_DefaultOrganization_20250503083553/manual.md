# Player Score Management Game

A simple application to manage player scores based on correct answers in a game setting.

## Overview

This application allows you to simulate a game where players answer questions and their scores are managed based on their performance. Players start with a set number of points, and their scores are decremented based on their answers. The final output indicates which players survived the game.

## Main Functions

- **Initialize Players**: Set the number of players and their initial scores.
- **Input Correct Answers**: Read the correct answers from players and update their scores accordingly.
- **Determine Survival Status**: Identify which players have scores greater than zero and display their survival status.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the number of players (N), initial points (K), and the number of correct answers (Q) in a single line, separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter number of players (N), initial points (K), and number of correct answers (Q): 5 10 3
   ```

4. **Enter Correct Answers**: Next, input the correct answers provided by the players, separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter correct answers (space-separated): 1 3 5
   ```

5. **View Results**: The application will output a single line containing N integers (0 or 1), indicating whether each player survived the game (1 for survived, 0 for eliminated).

## Example Usage

```
Enter number of players (N), initial points (K), and number of correct answers (Q): 4 5 2
Enter correct answers (space-separated): 2 4
```

Output:
```
1 0 1 0
```

In this example, Player 1 and Player 3 survived, while Player 2 and Player 4 were eliminated.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for input validation. If the input does not meet the expected format or constraints, an error message will be displayed.
