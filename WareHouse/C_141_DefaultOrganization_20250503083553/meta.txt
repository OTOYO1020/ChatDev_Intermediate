Task:
Read integers N (number of players), K (initial points), and Q (number of correct answers) from standard input. Initialize an array 'scores' of size N with all elements set to K, representing the initial scores of each player. Read the sequence of correct answers, which consists of Q integers, and store them in an array 'A'. For each correct answer in 'A', decrement the score of each player except the one who answered correctly:\n   - For each index 'i' in 'A', update 'scores[A[i] - 1]' (the player who answered correctly) to remain unchanged.\n   - For all other players, decrement their scores by 1. After processing all answers, determine which players have scores greater than 0 and store their survival status in a boolean array 'survived'. Print the survival status of each player (1 for survived, 0 for eliminated) based on the 'survived' array.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output should be a single line containing N integers (0 or 1), indicating whether each player survived the game.
