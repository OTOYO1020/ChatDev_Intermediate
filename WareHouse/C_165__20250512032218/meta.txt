Task:
Define a function 'max_score(N: int, M: int, Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> int' to encapsulate the solution logic. Parse the input to extract integers N, M, Q, and the list of quadruples (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i) from the input format. Initialize a sequence A of length N with all elements set to 1, ensuring that 1 ≤ A_1 ≤ A_2 ≤ ... ≤ A_N ≤ M. Implement a method to generate all non-decreasing sequences of length N with values between 1 and M. For each generated sequence A, calculate the score by iterating through the list of queries and summing d_i for valid conditions (A[b_i] - A[a_i] = c_i). Keep track of the maximum score encountered while evaluating all possible sequences. Ensure that the conditions for valid indices (1 ≤ a_i < b_i ≤ N) are respected during score calculation. Handle edge cases where no valid sequences yield a score, ensuring the function returns 0 in such cases. Optimize the score calculation to avoid redundant checks for sequences that have already been evaluated. Return the maximum score found as the output of the function.
