Define the function 'is_convex_quadrilateral(A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y, C_x, C_y, D_x, D_y)' to determine if the quadrilateral formed by the points is convex. Implement input handling to read the coordinates of the four vertices from standard input, ensuring they are integers within the specified range. Store the coordinates in appropriate variables: 'A = (A_x, A_y)', 'B = (B_x, B_y)', 'C = (C_x, C_y)', 'D = (D_x, D_y)'. Calculate the vectors representing the edges of the quadrilateral: 'AB', 'BC', 'CD', and 'DA'. Compute the cross products of adjacent edge vectors to determine the orientation of the angles at each vertex. Check if all computed angles are less than 180 degrees by analyzing the signs of the cross products. Return 'True' if the quadrilateral is convex (all angles < 180 degrees), otherwise return 'False'. Implement error handling for invalid input cases, ensuring that no two vertices are the same and no three vertices are collinear. Create test cases to validate the function with various quadrilateral configurations, including convex and non-convex cases. Output the result of the function as 'Yes' if the quadrilateral is convex and 'No' otherwise.
