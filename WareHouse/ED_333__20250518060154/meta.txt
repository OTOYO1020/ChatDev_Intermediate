Task:
Define the function 'adventure(N: int, events: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[str]]' to handle the input format where 'N' is the number of events and 'events' is a list of tuples representing each event. Parse the input to extract the number of events 'N' and the list of events 'events' from the input format. Initialize a data structure to keep track of the potions collected by Takahashi, such as a dictionary or a list indexed by potion type. Iterate through each event in 'events' and implement the logic to handle the two types of events: if 't_i = 1', update the potion count; if 't_i = 2', check if Takahashi can defeat the monster using the available potions. Implement a strategy to decide whether to pick up or discard potions based on the current state and future events, ensuring that Takahashi can defeat all monsters. Keep track of the maximum number of potions 'K' at any point during the adventure and the minimum value of 'K_min' across all strategies that allow Takahashi to survive. If Takahashi cannot defeat all monsters, prepare to return '-1' as the output. If Takahashi can defeat all monsters, prepare to return the value of 'K_min' and the sequence of actions taken to achieve this minimum. Format the output to include either '-1' or the tuple containing 'K_min' and the list of actions. Ensure the function handles edge cases, such as when all events are of one type or when no potions are collected.
