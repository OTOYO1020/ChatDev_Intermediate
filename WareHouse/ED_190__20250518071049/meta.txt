Task:
Define the function 'can_form_sequence(N: int, M: int, pairs: List[Tuple[int, int]], required_gems: List[int]) -> Tuple[bool, int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract integers N, M, pairs of adjacent gems, and the list of required gems. Create a graph representation of the gems where edges represent the pairs of gems that can be adjacent. Implement a function to check if all required gems can be included in a sequence by performing a graph traversal (e.g., BFS or DFS). Count the number of connected components in the graph to determine how many groups of gems can be formed. For each connected component, check if it contains at least one of the required gems. If all required gems are present in the connected components, calculate the minimum number of gems needed to form a valid sequence. Return a tuple indicating whether a valid sequence can be formed and the minimum number of gems required. Handle edge cases such as when M is 0 or when K is 1. Format the output according to the requirements, indicating if the sequence can be formed and the minimum number of gems needed.
