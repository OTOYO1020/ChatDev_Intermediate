Here's a detailed user manual for the `can_form_sequence` software, formatted in Markdown:

# Gem Sequence

A Python application to determine if a valid sequence of gems can be formed based on given pairs of adjacent gems and required gems.

## Quick Install

To run the Gem Sequence application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Gem Sequence application allows users to check if all required gems can be included in a sequence based on adjacency rules defined by pairs of gems. The application constructs a graph representation of the gems and performs graph traversal to determine the connectivity of the gems.

### Main Functions

- **`can_form_sequence(N: int, M: int, pairs: List[Tuple[int, int]], required_gems: List[int]) -> Tuple[bool, int]`**: 
  - This is the main function that checks if a valid gem sequence can be formed.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `N`: Total number of gems.
    - `M`: Number of pairs of adjacent gems.
    - `pairs`: A list of tuples representing pairs of adjacent gems.
    - `required_gems`: A list of gems that are required to form the sequence.
  - **Returns**: A tuple indicating whether a valid sequence can be formed and the minimum number of gems required.

### Edge Cases Handled

- If there are no gems (`N == 0`).
- If there are no pairs (`M == 0`).
- If any required gems are invalid (not in the range of 1 to N).
- If there is only one required gem that is not present in the range of gems.

## How to Use

1. **Input Format**:
   - The first line should contain two integers, `N` and `M`, separated by a space.
   - The next `M` lines should each contain two integers representing a pair of adjacent gems.
   - The final line should contain the required gems separated by spaces.

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Save the main application code in a file named `main.py`.
   - Save the gem sequence logic in a file named `gem_sequence.py`.
   - Run the application using the command line:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Example Input**:
   ```
   5 4
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   4 5
   2 4
   ```

4. **Example Output**:
   ```
   Valid sequence can be formed with 2 gems.
   ```
