Task:
Define a function named 'count_valid_integers(X: str, M: int) -> int' to encapsulate the solution logic. Extract the greatest digit 'd' from the string 'X' using the function 'max(X)'. Convert this character to an integer. Determine the minimum base 'n' as 'd + 1'. Initialize a counter variable 'count' to zero to keep track of valid integers. Iterate over possible bases 'n' starting from 'd + 1' up to 'M + 1'. For each base 'n', convert the string 'X' to an integer using base 'n' and check if it is less than or equal to 'M'. If the converted integer is valid, increment the 'count' variable. Continue this process until the base exceeds 'M'. Return the final count of valid integers from the function. Ensure the output format is an integer representing the count of valid integers.
