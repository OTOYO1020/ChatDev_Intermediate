# Count Valid Integers Application

This application defines a function to count valid integers based on a given string representation of a number and a maximum value. It is designed to help users determine how many valid integer representations can be derived from a string in various numerical bases.

## Main Functions

- **count_valid_integers(X: str, M: int) -> int**: This function encapsulates the logic to count valid integers. It takes a string `X` and an integer `M` as inputs and returns the count of valid integers that can be formed from `X` in bases ranging from the maximum digit in `X` plus one up to `M + 1`.

### Key Features:
- Validates that all characters in the input string are digits.
- Determines the minimum base for conversion based on the highest digit in the string.
- Counts how many valid integer representations exist for bases from the minimum base up to `M + 1`.

## Installation Instructions

This application does not require any external dependencies. To set up the environment, simply ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can check your Python installation by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to keep your dependencies organized:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install any required dependencies (if you decide to add any in the future):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. Run the application by executing the `main.py` file:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. You will be prompted to enter a string `X`. This string should consist solely of digit characters (0-9).
3. Next, enter the maximum value `M`. This should be a non-negative integer.
4. The application will process your input and output the count of valid integers that can be formed from the string `X` in the specified bases.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter string X: 123
Enter maximum value M: 10
Valid integers count: 3
```

In this example, the application counts how many valid integer representations can be derived from the string "123" in various bases, considering the maximum value of 10.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to count valid integers based on a string input and a maximum value. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it a valuable tool for anyone needing to perform such calculations.
