Define the function 'find_kth_occurrence(N: int, A: List[int], Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the values of N, the sequence A, Q, and the list of queries. Initialize a dictionary to store the occurrences of each number in A as we iterate through it. For each element in A, update the dictionary with the index of each occurrence of the number. For each query (x_i, k_i), check if x_i exists in the dictionary and if it has at least k_i occurrences. If x_i has at least k_i occurrences, retrieve the index of the k_i-th occurrence from the dictionary. If x_i does not have k_i occurrences, prepare to return -1 for that query. Store the results of each query in a list to be returned after processing all queries. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when A is empty or when queries exceed the bounds. Return the list of results as the output of the function in the required format.
