Task:
Define the function 'count_safe_squares(N: int, M: int, pieces: List[Tuple[int, int]])' to handle the input parameters where N is the grid size, M is the number of pieces, and pieces is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the pieces on the grid. Initialize a set to keep track of all squares that are attacked by existing pieces based on their positions. Iterate through each piece in the 'pieces' list and for each piece at position (a_k, b_k), mark all squares in the same row, column, and diagonals as attacked. For each piece at (a_k, b_k), calculate the attacked squares in the same row (a_k, j) for j from 1 to N, and add them to the attacked set. For each piece at (a_k, b_k), calculate the attacked squares in the same column (i, b_k) for i from 1 to N, and add them to the attacked set. For each piece at (a_k, b_k), calculate the attacked squares in the diagonal (i, i + (b_k - a_k)) for valid i values, and add them to the attacked set. For each piece at (a_k, b_k), calculate the attacked squares in the anti-diagonal (i, i - (b_k - a_k)) for valid i values, and add them to the attacked set. After processing all pieces, calculate the total number of empty squares in the grid by subtracting the size of the attacked set from N^2. Return the count of safe squares where a new piece can be placed without being captured. Ensure the output is an integer representing the number of safe squares.
