Task:
Define a function 'max_11_22_length(S: str) -> int' to find the maximum length of a contiguous substring of S that is an 11/22 string. Implement input handling to read the string S from standard input, ensuring it meets the constraints of length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200,000) and contains at least one '/'. Check if the length of S is odd; if not, return 0 since an 11/22 string must have an odd length. Iterate through the string S to find all possible substrings that contain at least one '/' and check their lengths. For each substring, determine if it satisfies the conditions of an 11/22 string: first half must be all '1's, the middle character must be '/', and the second half must be all '2's. Keep track of the maximum length of valid 11/22 substrings found during the iteration. Return the maximum length found as the output of the function. Implement edge case handling for strings that are too short to contain a valid 11/22 string. Ensure the function is optimized to handle the upper limit of N efficiently, ideally in O(N) time complexity. Output the result as an integer representing the maximum length of the contiguous 11/22 substring.
