# Character Replacer

A simple application for replacing characters in a string based on user-defined pairs.

## Main Functions

The Character Replacer application allows users to:
- Read an integer value for the length of the string and the number of replacement operations.
- Input a string of specified length.
- Define pairs of characters for replacement operations.
- Replace all occurrences of specified characters in the string with new characters.
- Output the modified string after all replacements have been applied.

## Quick Install

To run the Character Replacer application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt`:

```
# requirements.txt
# Add any required libraries here, if needed
```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: 
   Execute the `main.py` script in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - First, enter the integer values for `N` (length of the string) and `Q` (number of replacement operations) separated by a space. For example:
     ```
     5 2
     ```
   - Next, input the string `S` of length `N`. For example:
     ```
     hello
     ```
   - Then, for each of the `Q` operations, input the pairs of characters `(c_i, d_i)` that you want to replace. Each pair should be space-separated. For example:
     ```
     h e
     o a
     ```

3. **Output**:
   After entering all the required data, the application will process the replacements and print the modified string. For the example above, the output would be:
   ```
   ellea
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to use the Character Replacer application:

```plaintext
Input:
5 2
hello
h e
o a

Output:
ellea
```

## Additional Information

- Ensure that the length of the string matches the value of `N` you provide.
- Each character in the pairs must be a single character.
- The application processes the replacements in the order they are provided.
