Read the integer N and the non-negative integer D from standard input. Initialize a list 'points' to store the coordinates of the points. For i from 1 to N, read each point (x_i, y_i) and append it to the 'points' list. Determine the minimum and maximum x-coordinates from the 'points' list to define the search range for x. Determine the minimum and maximum y-coordinates from the 'points' list to define the search range for y. Initialize a counter 'count' to zero to keep track of valid integer pairs (x, y). For each integer x in the range from min_x - D to max_x + D:\n   - For each integer y in the range from min_y - D to max_y + D:\n     - Calculate the total distance 'total_distance' using the formula: \n       \[\n       total\_distance = \sum_{i=1}^N (|x - x_i| + |y - y_i|)\n       \]\n     - If 'total_distance' is less than or equal to D, increment the 'count'. Print the final value of 'count' as the output.
