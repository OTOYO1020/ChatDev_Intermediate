# Point Distance Calculator

A software tool for calculating valid integer pairs based on a set of points and a specified distance.

## Quick Install

To run the Point Distance Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Point Distance Calculator allows users to input a set of points in a 2D space and a distance value. The software then calculates how many integer coordinate pairs (x, y) exist within a specified distance from the given points. This can be useful in various applications such as geographic data analysis, clustering, and spatial computations.

## ðŸ“– Main Functions

1. **Input Points**: The user can input a specified number of points (N) in the format (x,y).
2. **Distance Calculation**: The software computes the total Manhattan distance from each integer pair (x, y) within a defined range to all input points.
3. **Count Valid Pairs**: It counts how many of these pairs have a total distance less than or equal to a specified distance (D).

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Points (N)**:
   When prompted, enter a positive integer for the number of points you wish to input.

3. **Input the Non-Negative Distance (D)**:
   Enter a non-negative integer for the distance.

4. **Input Points**:
   For each point, enter the coordinates in the format `x,y`. Ensure that both x and y are integers within the range of -10^6 to 10^6.

5. **View Results**:
   After entering all points, the software will calculate and display the count of valid integer pairs (x, y) that meet the distance criteria.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter number of points (N): 3
Enter non-negative distance (D): 5
Enter point 1 (x,y): 1,2
Enter point 2 (x,y): 3,4
Enter point 3 (x,y): -1,-1
Valid integer pairs count: 20
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-positive integer for N, the software will prompt you to enter a valid positive integer.
- If you enter a negative integer for D, the software will prompt you to enter a valid non-negative integer.
- If the point format is incorrect or out of bounds, the software will ask you to re-enter the point.

## Conclusion

The Point Distance Calculator is a powerful tool for spatial analysis and can be easily integrated into larger applications requiring distance calculations. For further assistance or feature requests, please contact our support team.
