Task:
Define the function 'find_minimum_path_weights(N: int, M: int, A: List[int], edges: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the number of vertices, 'M' is the number of edges, 'A' is a list of weights for each vertex, and 'edges' is a list of tuples representing each edge with its weights. Parse the input to extract the number of vertices 'N', number of edges 'M', the vertex weights 'A', and the edge information from the input format. Construct an adjacency list representation of the graph using the edge information provided in the 'edges' list. Implement a function to calculate the minimum weight path from vertex '1' to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest path algorithm, taking into account both vertex and edge weights. Iterate through each vertex 'i' from '2' to 'N' and compute the minimum weight path from vertex '1' to vertex 'i'. Store the results of the minimum weights in a list 'min_weights' where 'min_weights[i-1]' corresponds to the minimum weight from vertex '1' to vertex 'i'. Ensure that the algorithm efficiently handles the constraints of up to '200,000' vertices and edges, optimizing for time complexity. Return the list 'min_weights' as the output of the function, which contains the minimum path weights for each vertex from '1' to 'i'. Implement error handling for invalid input values or formats, ensuring all constraints are respected. Output the results in the specified format, ensuring that the minimum weights are printed in the correct order corresponding to vertices '2' through 'N'.
