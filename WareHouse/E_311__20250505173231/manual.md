# Holeless Squares Calculator

A Python application to calculate the number of holeless squares in a grid based on user-defined dimensions and holed square coordinates.

## Main Functions

The Holeless Squares Calculator provides the following main functionalities:

- **Grid Initialization**: Create a grid of specified dimensions (H x W).
- **Holed Squares Input**: Input the coordinates of squares that contain holes.
- **Holeless Squares Calculation**: Count and return the number of squares that do not contain any holes.

## Quick Install

To run the Holeless Squares Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Currently, there are no additional dependencies required beyond Python's standard library.*

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Grid Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the height (H) and width (W) of the grid separated by a space. For example:

   ```
   5 5
   ```

3. **Input Number of Holed Squares**: Enter the number of holed squares (N). For example:

   ```
   3
   ```

4. **Input Holed Square Coordinates**: For the next N lines, input the coordinates of the holed squares. Each coordinate should be in the format (a_i, b_i), where both a_i and b_i are integers representing the row and column of the holed square. For example:

   ```
   1 2
   3 4
   2 2
   ```

   *Note: Coordinates are 1-indexed, and the application will adjust them to 0-indexed for processing.*

5. **View Results**: After entering all the data, the application will calculate and print the total number of holeless squares in the grid.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
5 5
3
1 2
3 4
2 2
```

Output:
```
12
```

In this example, the grid is 5x5, and there are 3 holed squares. The application outputs `12`, indicating that there are 12 holeless squares in the grid.

## Error Handling

- If you enter a negative number for N, the application will display an error message and terminate.
- If you input coordinates that are out of the grid bounds, a warning will be displayed, and those coordinates will be ignored.

## Conclusion

The Holeless Squares Calculator is a straightforward tool for determining the number of holeless squares in a grid. It is designed for ease of use and provides clear feedback for user inputs. For any further inquiries or support, please contact the development team.
