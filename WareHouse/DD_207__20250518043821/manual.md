# Point Transformation Checker

A Python application to determine if one set of points can be transformed into another through rotation and translation.

## Main Functions

The application provides the following main functionalities:

1. **canTransform(S: List[Tuple[int, int]], T: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool**: 
   - Determines if set S can be transformed into set T by checking all possible rotations and translations.
   
2. **rotate(point: Tuple[int, int], angle: float) -> Tuple[float, float]**: 
   - Rotates a given point around the origin by a specified angle in degrees.

3. **translate(point: Tuple[int, int], q: float, r: float) -> Tuple[float, float]**: 
   - Translates a point by q units in the x-direction and r units in the y-direction.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not have a `requirements.txt` file, you can simply run the application without additional dependencies as it uses standard libraries.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input Data**: 
   - The input should consist of two lines. The first line contains the points of set S, and the second line contains the points of set T. Each point should be in the format `(x,y)` and separated by spaces.

   Example input:
   ```
   (1,2) (2,3) (3,4)
   (4,5) (5,6) (6,7)
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: 
   - You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. Use the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Data**: 
   - The application will read the input from standard input. You can either type the input directly or redirect from a file.

4. **Output**: 
   - The application will output `YES` if set S can be transformed into set T, otherwise it will output `NO`.

## Example Usage

To check if the points in set S can be transformed into set T, you can run the application and provide the input as follows:

```bash
echo -e "(1,2) (2,3) (3,4)\n(4,5) (5,6) (6,7)" | python main.py
```

This will output `NO` or `YES` based on the transformation possibility.

## Edge Cases

The application handles edge cases such as:
- When N is zero (empty sets).
- When N is at its maximum limit (ensure unique points).
