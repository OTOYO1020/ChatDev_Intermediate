Task:
Define the function 'canTransform(S: List[Tuple[int, int]], T: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool' to determine if set S can be transformed into set T. Parse the input to extract the number of points N and the two sets S and T, ensuring that S and T contain N unique points each. Implement a helper function 'rotate(point: Tuple[int, int], angle: float) -> Tuple[float, float]' to rotate a point by a given angle around the origin. Implement a helper function 'translate(point: Tuple[int, int], q: float, r: float) -> Tuple[float, float]' to translate a point by q in the x-direction and r in the y-direction. Generate all possible rotations of set S by angles p in the range (0, 360) and store the results. For each rotated version of S, calculate the necessary translations (q, r) to match each point in T. Check if there exists a single translation (q, r) that can transform any rotated version of S to match T. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when N is at its minimum or maximum limits. Return True if S can be transformed into T, otherwise return False. Output the result in the format 'YES' if transformation is possible, otherwise 'NO'.
