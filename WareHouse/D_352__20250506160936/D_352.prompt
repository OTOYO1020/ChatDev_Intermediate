Read integers N and K from standard input. Read the permutation array P of length N. Initialize a variable 'min_distance' to a large value (e.g., infinity). Use a sliding window approach to iterate through all possible starting indices 'i_1' from 1 to N-K+1:\n   - For each 'i_1', calculate the ending index 'i_K = i_1 + K - 1'.\n   - Extract the subsequence 'subsequence = (P[i_1], P[i_1+1], ..., P[i_K])'. Check if the extracted 'subsequence' can be rearranged to form a consecutive integer sequence:\n   - Sort the 'subsequence'.\n   - Verify if the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the sorted 'subsequence' is equal to K-1. If the condition is satisfied, update 'min_distance' with the value of 'i_K - i_1'. After iterating through all possible starting indices, check if 'min_distance' was updated; if not, handle the case accordingly. Print the value of 'min_distance' as the result. Ensure that all index calculations are 1-based as per the problem statement. Handle edge cases where K = 1 separately, as any single index is a good index sequence by default.
