Task:
Read the integer X from standard input, ensuring that it falls within the range \(1 \leq X < 10^{500000}\). Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to store the cumulative sum of the floor values. Initialize a variable 'k' to 0 to represent the current power of 10. While \(10^k\) is less than or equal to X:\n   - Calculate the floor value using 'floor_value = X // (10 ** k)'.\n   - Add 'floor_value' to 'total_sum'.\n   - Increment 'k' by 1. Once the loop ends (when \(10^k\) exceeds X), print the value of 'total_sum' as the final output.
