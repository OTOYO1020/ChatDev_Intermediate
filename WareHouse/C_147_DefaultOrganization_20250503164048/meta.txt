Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of people. Initialize a list of testimonies, where each entry corresponds to a person and contains their testimonies as tuples of (x_ij, y_ij). For each person i (from 1 to N), read the integer A_i, which indicates the number of testimonies they provide. For each testimony j (from 1 to A_i) of person i, read the integers x_ij and y_ij, and store them in the testimonies list. Create a function 'is_honest(possible_honest)' that takes a set of possible honest persons and checks the validity of testimonies based on their honesty. Use a loop to generate all possible combinations of honest persons (up to 15 people) and call 'is_honest' for each combination. Count the maximum number of honest persons that can be validated as honest based on the testimonies. Store the maximum count of honest persons found during the iterations. Print the maximum count of honest persons.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function: 'is_honest(possible_honest)'\n- Variables: 'N', 'A_i', 'testimonies', 'possible_honest', 'max_honest_count'
