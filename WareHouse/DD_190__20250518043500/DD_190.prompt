Define a function 'count_arithmetic_progressions(N: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting arithmetic progressions with a given sum N. Implement input handling to read the integer N from standard input, ensuring it meets the constraint 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12. Initialize a variable 'count' to zero to keep track of the number of valid arithmetic progressions. Iterate through possible values of the first term 'a' starting from 1 up to N, as the first term must be a positive integer. For each value of 'a', calculate the number of terms 'k' in the arithmetic progression using the formula derived from the sum of an arithmetic series. Check if the calculated number of terms 'k' is a positive integer and if the resulting arithmetic progression sum equals N. If the conditions are satisfied, increment the 'count' variable by 1. Continue iterating until all possible first terms have been checked. Return the final count of arithmetic progressions from the function. Print the output in the required format, which is the integer count of arithmetic progressions.
