# Arithmetic Progression Counter

A Python application for counting the number of arithmetic progressions that sum to a given integer \( N \).

## Overview

This software allows users to input a positive integer \( N \) (where \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^{12} \)) and calculates how many valid arithmetic progressions can be formed that sum to \( N \). An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter a positive integer \( N \).
- **Counting Arithmetic Progressions**: The core function `count_arithmetic_progressions(N: int) -> int` computes the number of valid arithmetic progressions that sum to \( N \).
- **Output**: The application prints the total count of arithmetic progressions found.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system like Git, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Prompt**: The application will prompt you to enter a positive integer \( N \):
   ```
   Enter a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12):
   ```

3. **Enter Value**: Input a value for \( N \) that meets the specified constraints. For example:
   ```
   15
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering a valid integer, the application will calculate and display the number of arithmetic progressions that sum to \( N \):
   ```
   Number of arithmetic progressions: <count>
   ```

## Example

For an input of \( N = 15 \):
```
Enter a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12): 15
Number of arithmetic progressions: 4
```

This indicates that there are 4 valid arithmetic progressions that sum to 15.

## Error Handling

- If the input is not a valid integer or does not meet the constraints, the application will display an error message:
  ```
  Input Error: N must be between 1 and 10^12.
  ```

## Conclusion

This application is a simple yet powerful tool for counting arithmetic progressions based on a given sum. Feel free to modify the code to enhance its functionality or integrate it into larger projects.
