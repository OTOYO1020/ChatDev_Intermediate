# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**‚ùì Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**ü§ñ Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## üìñ Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

## How to Use the Software

To use the software, please follow the steps below:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the main.py file to start the program:

```
python main.py
```

3. The program will open a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can enter two sequences of non-negative integers.

4. Enter the sequences in the input fields provided and click the "Check" button.

5. The program will calculate the number of integers that satisfy the given condition and display the result in a message box.

6. You can repeat steps 3-5 to check different sequences.

7. To exit the program, simply close the GUI window.

Please note that the program assumes the input sequences are space-separated integers. If your sequences are in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please refer to the documentation or contact our support team for assistance.

Enjoy using our software!
