Define the function 'count_subordinates(N: int, A: List[int]) -> List[int]' to accept the number of members and their immediate bosses. Initialize a list 'subordinate_count' of size N+1 with all elements set to 0 to keep track of the number of immediate subordinates for each member. Iterate through the list 'A' from index 1 to N-1 (corresponding to members 2 to N) and for each member 'i', increment 'subordinate_count[A[i]]' by 1 to count the immediate subordinate. Return the list 'subordinate_count' excluding the first element (index 0) since member IDs start from 1. Ensure that the input list 'A' is of length N-1 and contains values in the range [1, i-1] for each i in [2, N]. Handle input reading from standard input, parsing the first line for N and the second line for the list A. Convert the input data into appropriate types: N as an integer and A as a list of integers. Call the function 'count_subordinates(N, A)' with the parsed inputs to compute the subordinate counts. Format the output as a space-separated string of subordinate counts for members 1 to N. Print the formatted output to standard output.
