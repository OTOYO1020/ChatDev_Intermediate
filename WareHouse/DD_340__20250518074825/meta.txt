Task:
Define the function 'min_time_to_stage_n(N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int], X: List[int]) -> int' to calculate the minimum time to reach stage N. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the lists A, B, and X from the input format. Initialize a list 'dp' of size N+1 with infinity to represent the minimum time to reach each stage, setting 'dp[1]' to 0 since stage 1 is the starting point. Iterate through each stage 'i' from 1 to N-1, and for each stage, calculate the time to reach stage 'i+1' using 'dp[i] + A[i-1]' and update 'dp[i+1]' if this time is less. For each stage 'i', calculate the time to reach stage 'X[i-1]' using 'dp[i] + B[i-1]' and update 'dp[X[i-1]]' if this time is less. Ensure to handle the constraints of the problem, particularly the bounds on N, A_i, B_i, and X_i. After processing all stages, the minimum time to reach stage N will be stored in 'dp[N]'. Return the value of 'dp[N]' as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when N is at its minimum value. Output the result in the specified format, which is an integer representing the minimum seconds required to reach stage N.
