# Minimum Time to Stage N Calculator

A simple Python application to calculate the minimum time required to reach stage N using given parameters.

## Main Functions

The software provides the following main functions:

- **min_time_to_stage_n(N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int], X: List[int]) -> int**: This function calculates the minimum time to reach stage N based on the input parameters:
  - `N`: The total number of stages.
  - `A`: A list of integers representing the time taken to move from stage i to stage i+1.
  - `B`: A list of integers representing the time taken to teleport from stage i to stage X[i-1].
  - `X`: A list of integers representing the teleportation destinations.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the source code files `main.py` and `min_time.py` to your local machine.

2. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the files are located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Parameters**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - `N`: Enter the total number of stages (must be at least 1).
   - `A`: Enter the time taken to move from stage i to stage i+1 as a comma-separated list (only required if N > 1).
   - `B`: Enter the time taken to teleport from stage i to stage X[i-1] as a comma-separated list (only required if N > 1).
   - `X`: Enter the teleportation destinations as a comma-separated list (only required if N > 1).

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter N: 5
   Enter A (comma-separated): 2,3,1,4
   Enter B (comma-separated): 5,2,3,1
   Enter X (comma-separated): 2,3,4,5
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the parameters, the application will calculate and display the minimum time required to reach stage N.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Minimum time to reach stage 5: 6 seconds
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling to ensure that:
- `N` is at least 1.
- Lists `A`, `B`, and `X` have the correct lengths (N-1).
- All values in `A` and `B` are non-negative.
- All values in `X` are positive integers within the range of stages.

If any input is invalid, the application will display an appropriate error message.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to calculate the minimum time to reach a specific stage in a series of stages using given parameters. For further assistance or inquiries, please contact the support team.
