Here is the `manual.md` file that provides a detailed user manual for the software developed to count elements in a list based on user queries.

# Count Elements Application

A Python application for counting occurrences of integers in a list based on user-defined queries.

## Overview

This application allows users to input a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray of the list and an integer to count within that subarray. The application will return the count of occurrences of the specified integer for each query.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user for the number of elements in the list, the list itself, the number of queries, and the details of each query.
- **Count Elements**: For each query, the application extracts the specified subarray and counts the occurrences of the given integer.
- **Output Results**: The application prints the results of each query on a new line.

## Installation

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install typing
```

(Note: The `typing` module is included in the standard library for Python 3.5 and above, so you may not need to install it separately.)

## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Run the Application

Navigate to the directory where the application files (`main.py` and `count_elements.py`) are located. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Input Data

1. **Enter the number of elements (N)**: Input a positive integer that represents the number of elements in the list.
2. **Enter the list of integers**: Provide exactly N integers separated by spaces.
3. **Enter the number of queries (Q)**: Input a positive integer that represents the number of queries you want to make.
4. **Enter each query**: For each query, input three integers L, R, and X separated by spaces:
   - L: The starting index of the subarray (1-based).
   - R: The ending index of the subarray (1-based).
   - X: The integer to count in the subarray.

### Step 3: View Results

After entering all queries, the application will output the count of occurrences of X for each query on a new line.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of elements in the list (N): 5
Enter 5 integers (space-separated): 1 2 3 2 1
Enter the number of queries (Q): 2
Enter L, R, X (space-separated): 1 5 2
Enter L, R, X (space-separated): 2 4 2
```

**Output:**
```
2
1
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that all inputs are integers and follow the specified constraints.
- If you encounter any errors, check the input format and try again.
