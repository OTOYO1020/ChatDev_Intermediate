Define a function named count_elements(A: List[int], queries: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) that takes a list A of integers and a list of queries, where each query is a tuple containing integers L, R, and X. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the sequence A of length N from standard input. Implement input handling to read the integer Q, followed by Q queries, each containing integers L, R, and X. Ensure that the input values for L, R, and X are within the specified constraints (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N, 1 ≤ X ≤ N). For each query, extract the subarray A[L-1:R] from the list A to handle 0-based indexing. Count the occurrences of the integer X in the subarray A[L-1:R] using a loop or a suitable method. Store the result of each query (the count of occurrences) in a list results. After processing all queries, prepare to output the results. Implement output handling to print each result from the results list on a new line. Ensure that the function count_elements returns the results list for further use if needed.
