Read the integer \( N \) from standard input. Convert \( N \) into a string to access its digits. Generate all unique permutations of the digits in \( N \). For each permutation, split the digits into two non-empty parts to form two integers \( A \) and \( B \). Check if both \( A \) and \( B \) are positive integers without leading zeros:\n   - If either integer has a leading zero, discard that permutation. Calculate the product of \( A \) and \( B \) for valid pairs. Keep track of the maximum product found during the iterations. After evaluating all permutations, determine the maximum product. Print the maximum product as the output.
