Task:
Read integers N (number of cities), M (number of railroads), and the two cities X and Y from standard input. Initialize a graph representation to store the railroads, using an adjacency list where each entry contains pairs of connected cities and their respective travel times. For each railroad i (from 1 to M), read the endpoints A_i and B_i, and the travel time T_i and K_i. Store this information in the graph. Implement a priority queue (min-heap) to facilitate the Dijkstra-like algorithm for finding the earliest arrival time at City Y. Initialize a distance array to keep track of the earliest time to reach each city, starting with City X at time 0. For each city, calculate the next available departure time based on the current time and the frequency K_i of the trains. Update the earliest arrival times for connected cities based on the travel time T_i and the next available departure time. Continue processing until all reachable cities are evaluated or until City Y is reached. If City Y is reachable, output the earliest time to reach it; otherwise, report that City Y is unreachable. Print the result based on the computed times.
