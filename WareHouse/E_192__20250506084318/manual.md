# Railroad Application

The Railroad Application is designed to help users find the earliest arrival time between two cities using a graph representation of railroads. It implements a Dijkstra-like algorithm to calculate travel times based on train frequencies and travel durations.

## Main Functions

- **Graph Representation**: The application uses an adjacency list to represent the connections between cities and their respective travel times and frequencies.
- **Dijkstra-like Algorithm**: The algorithm calculates the earliest arrival time at a destination city, taking into account the frequency of train departures.
- **User Input Handling**: The application prompts users for input regarding the number of cities, railroads, and specific city connections, ensuring that all inputs are valid.

## Quick Install

To run the Railroad Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install heapq
```

Note: The `heapq` module is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required for it.

## How to Use the Railroad Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Cities**: Enter the total number of cities in the network. This must be a positive integer.

3. **Input the Number of Railroads**: Enter the total number of railroads connecting the cities. This can be zero or more.

4. **Specify Cities X and Y**: Enter the indices of the starting city (City X) and the destination city (City Y). Note that the input is 1-based, but the application adjusts for 0-based indexing.

5. **Input Railroad Connections**: For each railroad, provide the following details:
   - City A (starting city of the railroad)
   - City B (ending city of the railroad)
   - Travel time (time taken to travel between City A and City B)
   - Frequency (how often trains depart from City A to City B)

   Ensure that all inputs for cities and railroad data are valid integers and within the specified range.

6. **View Results**: After entering all the data, the application will compute the earliest arrival time at City Y. If City Y is reachable, the application will display the earliest time; otherwise, it will indicate that City Y is unreachable.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of cities: 5
Enter the number of railroads: 6
Enter City X: 1
Enter City Y: 5
Enter city A: 1
Enter city B: 2
Enter travel time: 10
Enter frequency: 5
Enter city A: 2
Enter city B: 3
Enter travel time: 15
Enter frequency: 10
Enter city A: 3
Enter city B: 4
Enter travel time: 10
Enter frequency: 5
Enter city A: 4
Enter city B: 5
Enter travel time: 5
Enter frequency: 2
```

Output:
```plaintext
Earliest arrival time at City Y: 35
```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure that:
- The number of cities and railroads are positive integers.
- City indices are within the valid range.
- Travel time and frequency are positive integers.
- City X and City Y are not the same.

If any input is invalid, the application will provide an appropriate error message and prompt the user to re-enter the data.

## Conclusion

The Railroad Application is a powerful tool for calculating travel times between cities based on railroad connections. By following the instructions above, users can easily navigate the application and obtain the desired results.
