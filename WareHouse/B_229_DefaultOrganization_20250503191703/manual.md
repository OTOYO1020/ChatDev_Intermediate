# Digit-Wise Addition Application

A simple application for performing digit-wise addition of two positive integers and determining if the result is "Easy" or "Hard".

## Main Functions

The application consists of two main components:

1. **User Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter two positive integers.
2. **Digit-Wise Addition Logic**: The application processes the integers to check if any digit-wise addition results in a carry.

### How It Works

- The application reads two positive integers from the user.
- It performs digit-wise addition from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.
- If any addition of corresponding digits (including any carry from the previous addition) exceeds 9, the result is classified as "Hard". Otherwise, it is classified as "Easy".

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries, so you can run it with just the standard Python installation.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Integers**: When prompted, enter the first positive integer (A) and press Enter. Then enter the second positive integer (B) and press Enter.

4. **View the Result**: The application will output either "Easy" or "Hard" based on the digit-wise addition of the two integers.

### Example Usage

```
Enter first positive integer (A): 123
Enter second positive integer (B): 456
Hard
```

```
Enter first positive integer (A): 12
Enter second positive integer (B): 7
Easy
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-positive integer, the application will raise an error and prompt you to enter positive integers only.
- Ensure that you enter valid integers to avoid input errors.
