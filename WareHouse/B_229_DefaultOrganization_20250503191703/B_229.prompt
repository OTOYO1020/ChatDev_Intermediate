Receive two positive integers A and B from standard input. Initialize a variable 'carry' to 0. Convert A and B to their string representations to facilitate digit-wise addition. Loop through the digits of A and B from the least significant to the most significant:\n   - For each pair of corresponding digits, calculate the sum.\n   - If the sum of the digits exceeds 9, set 'carry' to 1. After processing all digits, check the value of 'carry'. If 'carry' is 0, print 'Easy'; otherwise, print 'Hard'.
