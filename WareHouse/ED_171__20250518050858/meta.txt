Task:
Define the function 'restore_scarves(N: int, a: List[int]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters, where 'N' is the number of Snuke Cats and 'a' is the list of integers representing the xor values calculated by each Snuke Cat. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the list 'a' from standard input. Ensure that 'N' is even and within the constraints (2 ≤ N ≤ 200000). Calculate the total xor of all integers on the scarfs using the formula 'total_xor = a[0] xor a[1] xor ... xor a[N-1]'. For each Snuke Cat 'i', compute the integer on their scarf as 'scarf[i] = total_xor xor a[i]'. Store the computed integers in a list 'scarf'. Ensure that all computed integers are within the range (0 ≤ scarf[i] ≤ 10^9). Return the list 'scarf' from the function 'restore_scarves'. Implement output handling to print the integers in the list 'scarf' as space-separated values. Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness and performance within the given constraints.
