# Snuke Cat Scarf Calculator

A Python application to calculate scarf values for Snuke Cats based on XOR values.

## Overview

The Snuke Cat Scarf Calculator allows users to input the number of Snuke Cats and their corresponding XOR values. The application computes the scarf values for each Snuke Cat using the formula `scarf[i] = total_xor xor a[i]`, where `total_xor` is the XOR of all input values. This tool is designed for efficiency and can handle large inputs within specified constraints.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of Snuke Cats and their XOR values from standard input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the input values meet specified constraints (e.g., `N` is even, values are within the range).
- **Calculation**: Computes the total XOR and individual scarf values.
- **Output**: Prints the calculated scarf values as space-separated integers.

## Installation

To run the Snuke Cat Scarf Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.*

## Usage

1. **Prepare Input**: The input should consist of two lines:
   - The first line contains an even integer `N` (the number of Snuke Cats).
   - The second line contains `N` space-separated integers representing the XOR values.

   Example input:
   ```
   4
   1 2 3 4
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file. You can do this from the command line:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Provide Input**: The application will wait for you to input the required data. You can either type it directly or redirect from a file.

4. **View Output**: After processing, the application will output the scarf values as space-separated integers.

   Example output:
   ```
   4 5 6 7
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input issues, such as:
- Invalid integer format.
- `N` not being an even integer or out of range.
- Mismatched lengths between `N` and the list of XOR values.
- Values outside the valid range (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9).

If an error occurs, the application will print an appropriate error message and exit.

## Testing

To ensure correctness and performance, test the function with various inputs, including edge cases such as:
- Minimum and maximum values for `N`.
- All values at the boundary of the valid range.

## Conclusion

The Snuke Cat Scarf Calculator is a powerful tool for calculating scarf values based on XOR inputs. With its robust input validation and efficient computation, it is well-suited for handling large datasets.
