Task:
Define the function 'calculate_black_area(A: int, B: int, C: int, D: int) -> int' to handle the input parameters A, B, C, and D. Implement a method to determine the color of each region based on the provided lines: 'x = n', 'y = n', and 'x + y = n'. Create a grid representation of the regions within the rectangle defined by the coordinates (A, B) and (C, D). Implement a function to check the color of each region based on adjacency rules, ensuring adjacent regions have different colors. Calculate the total area of the black regions within the rectangle using the grid representation. Double the calculated area of the black regions to get the final result. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as very large or very small values of A, B, C, and D. Return the final result from the function as an integer. Write test cases to validate the function with various inputs, including boundary conditions. Print the output in the required format after calling the function.
