# Black Area Calculator

A Python application to calculate the area of black regions within a defined rectangle based on specific line equations.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this software is `calculate_black_area(A: int, B: int, C: int, D: int) -> int`, which computes the total area of black regions defined by the coordinates (A, B) and (C, D). The function considers the following lines:
- Vertical lines at `x = A` and `x = C`
- Horizontal lines at `y = B` and `y = D`
- Diagonal line defined by `x + y = n`

### Features:
- Handles edge cases for invalid rectangles and extreme values.
- Creates a grid representation of the defined rectangle.
- Implements adjacency rules to ensure adjacent regions have different colors.
- Calculates the total area of black regions and doubles the result.

## Installation

To run the Black Area Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the source code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install any required dependencies using pip. For this application, you may not need additional packages, but ensure you have `collections` available as it is part of the standard library.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Black Area Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Coordinates**: When prompted, enter the coordinates A, B, C, and D separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter A, B, C, D: 0 0 2 2
   ```

3. **View Result**: The application will calculate the total black area and print the result in the following format:
   ```
   The final black area is: <result>
   ```

## Test Cases

The application includes several test cases to validate the functionality of the `calculate_black_area` function. You can run these tests by executing the `main.py` file, which will automatically run assertions to ensure the function behaves as expected.

### Example Test Cases:
- `calculate_black_area(0, 0, 2, 2)` should return `8`
- `calculate_black_area(1, 1, 3, 3)` should return `8`
- `calculate_black_area(-1, -1, 1, 1)` should return `8`
- `calculate_black_area(0, 0, 0, 0)` should return `0`
- `calculate_black_area(5, 5, 5, 5)` should return `0`
- `calculate_black_area(0, 0, 1000, 1000)` should return `4000000`

## Conclusion

The Black Area Calculator is a powerful tool for calculating the area of black regions defined by specific lines within a rectangle. With its straightforward interface and robust functionality, it can handle a variety of input scenarios. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
