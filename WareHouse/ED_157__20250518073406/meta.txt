Task:
Define the function 'process_queries(S: str, queries: List[Tuple[int, ...]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input string 'S' and a list of queries. Parse the input string 'S' to determine its length 'N' and ensure it consists only of lowercase English letters. Iterate through the list of queries and differentiate between type 1 and type 2 queries based on the first element of each tuple. For type 1 queries, implement the logic to change the character at index 'i_q' in string 'S' to 'c_q' if it is different from the current character. For type 2 queries, implement a method to count the number of distinct characters in the substring of 'S' from index 'l_q' to 'r_q' (inclusive). Utilize a data structure (like a set) to efficiently track distinct characters in the specified substring for type 2 queries. Ensure that all index values are adjusted for 0-based indexing when accessing the string 'S'. Collect results from type 2 queries and store them in a list to be returned after processing all queries. Handle edge cases, such as when 'i_q' is out of bounds or when 'l_q' equals 'r_q' in type 2 queries. Return the list of results from type 2 queries as the output of the function.
