# Vote Counter

A simple application for processing votes and determining the most voted strings.

## Introduction

The Vote Counter application allows users to input a number of votes (strings) and determines which strings received the most votes. The application handles edge cases, such as unique votes or a single vote, and outputs the most voted strings in lexicographical order.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Accepts the number of votes and the corresponding strings from the user.
- **Vote Processing**: Counts the occurrences of each string and identifies the most voted strings.
- **Output**: Displays the most voted strings, sorted in lexicographical order.

## Installation

To run the Vote Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application requires no additional dependencies beyond Python's standard library. However, if you want to use type hints, ensure you have Python 3.5 or later.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Votes**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of votes (N) as a positive integer.
   - Then, input the votes as a comma-separated list (e.g., `apple, banana, apple, orange`).

4. **View Results**: The application will process the votes and display the most voted strings, each on a new line.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter number of votes (must be a positive integer): 5
Enter exactly 5 votes (comma separated, no leading/trailing spaces): apple, banana, apple, orange, banana
Most Voted Strings:
apple
banana
```

## Edge Cases Handled

- If all strings are unique, the application will return all strings sorted in lexicographical order.
- If there is only one vote, that string will be returned as the most voted.
- If the user inputs an incorrect number of votes, the application will prompt the user to enter the correct number.
