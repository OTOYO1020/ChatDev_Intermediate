Task:
Define a function 'find_most_voted_strings(N: int, votes: List[str]) -> List[str]' to encapsulate the logic for processing the votes. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list of strings votes from standard input. Create a dictionary to count the occurrences of each string in the votes list. Iterate through the votes list and populate the dictionary with the count of each string. Determine the maximum count of votes from the dictionary values. Extract all strings from the dictionary that have the maximum count. Sort the extracted strings in lexicographical order. Prepare the output format for the sorted list of strings. Implement the output handling to print the sorted strings, each on a new line. Ensure the function handles edge cases, such as when all strings are unique or when there is only one vote.
