# Even-Digit Palindrome Counter

A simple application to count even-digit palindromes up to a specified integer N.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this software is to count the number of even-digit palindromes from 1 to N. An even-digit palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards and has an even number of digits.

### Key Features:
- Input handling to ensure valid integer input.
- Efficient counting of even-digit palindromes.
- User-friendly output displaying the count of palindromes.

## Installation

To run the Even-Digit Palindrome Counter, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   This application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library.

## How to Use

1. **Run the application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input an integer**:
   When prompted, enter an integer value for N (where 1 ≤ N < 10^12). The application will validate your input.

3. **View the output**:
   After entering a valid integer, the application will display the count of even-digit palindromes up to that number.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter a number (1 ≤ N < 10^12): 100
Count of even-digit palindromes: 9
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a value outside the valid range (1 ≤ N < 10^12), the application will notify you with an error message:
  ```plaintext
  Error: N must be in the range 1 ≤ N < 10^12.
  ```

- If you enter a non-integer value, the application will prompt you with:
  ```plaintext
  Error: Please enter a valid integer.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Even-Digit Palindrome Counter is a straightforward tool for counting palindromic numbers with even digits. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it suitable for both casual users and developers looking to integrate palindrome counting functionality into their applications.
