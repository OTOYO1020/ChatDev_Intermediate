Define a function 'count_even_digit_palindromes(N: int) -> int' to encapsulate the main logic of counting valid integers x. Implement input handling to read the integer N from standard input. Check if N is within the valid range (1 â‰¤ N < 10^12). If not, handle the error appropriately. Initialize a counter variable 'count' to zero to keep track of valid integers x. Iterate through all integers x from 1 to N (inclusive). For each integer x, convert it to a string and check if its length is even. If the length is even, split the string representation of x into two halves and compare them. If the two halves are equal, increment the 'count' variable by 1. After the loop, return the value of 'count' as the result of the function. Print the output in the required format after calling 'count_even_digit_palindromes(N)'.
