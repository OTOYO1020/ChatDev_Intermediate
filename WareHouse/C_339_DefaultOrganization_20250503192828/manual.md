# Bus Passenger Tracking Application

A simple application to track the number of passengers on a bus across multiple stops. This application allows users to input changes in passenger counts at each stop and calculates the minimum possible number of passengers on the bus at any point during the journey.

## Main Functions

- **Track Passenger Changes**: The application reads the number of stops and the changes in passenger counts at each stop.
- **Calculate Minimum Passengers**: It calculates the minimum possible number of passengers on the bus, ensuring that the count does not go negative.
- **User-Friendly Input**: The application prompts users for input in a clear and straightforward manner.

## Installation

To run the Bus Passenger Tracking Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file if you plan to add dependencies in the future. For now, you can leave it empty or install any necessary packages directly using pip.

   To install any required packages, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have any dependencies yet, you can skip this step.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Stops**:
   When prompted, enter the total number of stops (N) for the bus journey.

3. **Input Passenger Changes**:
   For each stop, you will be prompted to enter the change in the number of passengers (A_i). This can be a positive number (boarding) or a negative number (alighting).

4. **View Results**:
   After entering all changes, the application will calculate and display the minimum possible current number of passengers on the bus.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of stops: 3
Enter change in passengers for stop 1: 5
Enter change in passengers for stop 2: -3
Enter change in passengers for stop 3: -4
Minimum possible current number of passengers: 2
```

## Conclusion

This application is designed to provide a simple yet effective way to track passenger counts on a bus. It can be extended in the future to include additional features such as data persistence, reporting, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
