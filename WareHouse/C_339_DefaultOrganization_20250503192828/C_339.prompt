Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of stops. Initialize a variable 'current_passengers' to 0 to track the number of passengers on the bus. Initialize a variable 'min_passengers' to 0 to keep track of the minimum possible number of passengers. Loop through the range from 1 to N to read the changes in passenger count:\n   - For each stop i, read the integer A_i from standard input.\n   - Update 'current_passengers' by adding A_i to it.\n   - If 'current_passengers' is less than 'min_passengers', update 'min_passengers' to 'current_passengers'. Calculate the minimum possible current number of passengers as '-min_passengers' (to ensure non-negative passengers). Print the result, which is the minimum possible current number of passengers on the bus.
