Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of players. Read the array A of length N, where A[i] represents the friendliness of player i. Initialize a variable 'total_comfort' to 0 to keep track of the maximum total comfort. Create a list 'arrival_order' to store the optimal order of player arrivals. Sort the array A in descending order to prioritize players with higher friendliness. For the first player in 'arrival_order', set their comfort to 0. For each subsequent player in 'arrival_order', calculate their comfort based on the friendliness of the players adjacent to them in the circle:\n   - Use a circular list to determine the clockwise and counter-clockwise players.\n   - Update 'total_comfort' with the minimum friendliness of the adjacent players. Print the final value of 'total_comfort' as the output.
