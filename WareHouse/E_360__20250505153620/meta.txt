Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input. Initialize a list 'positions' representing the arrangement of balls, with the black ball at index 0 and white balls at indices 1 to N-1. Initialize a variable 'expected_position' to 0 to accumulate the expected position of the black ball. For each operation from 1 to K:\n   - Randomly select two distinct integers 'a' and 'b' from the range [1, N].\n   - Swap the balls at positions 'a-1' and 'b-1' in the 'positions' list. After K operations, calculate the expected position of the black ball by iterating through the 'positions' list. Compute the irreducible fraction representation of the expected value as P/Q. Calculate R such that \( R \times Q \equiv P \mod 998244353 \). Ensure that \( Q \) is not congruent to 0 modulo 998244353. Print the result R. Handle any potential edge cases, such as when N = 1 or K = 0, to ensure the solution is robust.
