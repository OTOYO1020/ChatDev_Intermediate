Task:
Define a function named calculate_xor_sum that takes an integer N and a list of integers A as parameters. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list of integers A from standard input. Ensure that the length of list A is equal to N and that all elements satisfy the constraint 0 <= A[i] < 2^60. Initialize a variable total_sum to 0 to store the cumulative XOR sum. Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i < j <= N. In the inner loop, calculate the XOR of A[i-1] and A[j-1] (adjusting for 0-based indexing) and add it to total_sum. Apply modulo operation on total_sum with (10^9 + 7) to ensure the result stays within bounds. Return the final value of total_sum from the function. Implement error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring that N is within the specified range. Output the result of calculate_xor_sum in the required format.
