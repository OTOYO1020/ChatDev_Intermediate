# XOR Sum Calculator

A simple application to calculate the cumulative XOR sum of pairs of integers.

## Overview

The XOR Sum Calculator allows users to input a list of integers and computes the cumulative XOR sum of all unique pairs. This application is designed to handle large integers efficiently while ensuring that the results remain within specified bounds.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer `N` (the number of elements) and a list of integers `A` from standard input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the length of list `A` is equal to `N` and that all elements satisfy the constraint `0 <= A[i] < 2^60`.
- **XOR Calculation**: Computes the XOR for all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= N` and returns the cumulative sum modulo `(10^9 + 7)`.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages for invalid inputs.

## Installation

To run the XOR Sum Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of elements and the list of integers.
   - Example Input:
     ```
     Enter the number of elements (N): 4
     Enter the elements (space-separated): 1 2 3 4
     ```

4. **View Results**: The application will output the cumulative XOR sum.
   - Example Output:
     ```
     XOR Sum: 14
     ```

## Error Handling

If the input does not meet the specified criteria, the application will display an error message. For example:
- If `N` is not a positive integer:
  ```
  Input Error: N must be a positive integer.
  ```
- If the length of list `A` does not match `N`:
  ```
  Input Error: The length of the list A must be equal to N.
  ```
- If any element in `A` is out of bounds:
  ```
  Input Error: Each element must satisfy the constraint 0 <= A[i] < 2^60.
  ```

## Conclusion

The XOR Sum Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating XOR sums of integer pairs. It is designed to be user-friendly with robust input validation and error handling. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
