Define a function 'count_ways(S: str) -> int' to handle the input string S. Initialize a constant 'MOD = 10**9 + 7' to handle the modulo operation. Create a list 'target = ['c', 'h', 'o', 'k', 'u', 'd', 'a', 'i']' to represent the characters to be chosen. Implement a loop to iterate through the string S and count occurrences of each character in 'target'. Use dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to choose the characters from S that match the sequence in 'target'. Store intermediate results in a list or array to optimize the calculation of combinations. Ensure that the final count is computed modulo 'MOD' to prevent overflow. Return the final count from the function 'count_ways'. Handle edge cases where the length of S is less than 8 by returning 0. Print the output of the function call to display the result.
