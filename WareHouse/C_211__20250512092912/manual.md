# Character Combination Counter

A Python application for counting the number of ways to choose a specific sequence of characters from a given string.

## Overview

This application defines a function `count_ways(S: str) -> int` that calculates the number of ways to select characters from the input string `S` that match the sequence defined in the target list `['c', 'h', 'o', 'k', 'u', 'd', 'a', 'i']`. The result is computed modulo `10**9 + 7` to prevent overflow.

## Main Functions

- **count_ways(S: str) -> int**: This function takes a string `S` as input and returns the number of ways to form the sequence of characters defined in the target list. If the length of `S` is less than 8, it returns 0.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# Currently, there are no specific dependencies required for this application.
# You can add commonly used libraries here for future extensibility.
```

Then, you can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input String**: When prompted, enter a string from which you want to count the character combinations.

4. **View Result**: The application will output the number of ways to form the target sequence from the input string.

## Example Usage

```bash
Enter a string: chookudai
Number of ways: 1
```

In this example, the input string "chookudai" contains all the characters in the target sequence exactly once, resulting in one way to form the sequence.

## Edge Cases

- If the input string is empty or has a length less than 8, the application will return 0.

```bash
Enter a string: abc
Number of ways: 0
```

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to count character combinations based on a predefined target sequence. It can be extended in the future to include additional features or functionalities as needed.
