# Candy Box Program

A simple application to determine if candy boxes can be purchased based on given price and candy requirements.

## Main Functions

The Candy Box program includes the following main functions:

- **can_buy_boxes(N: int, M: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> Tuple[bool, int]**: 
  - This function takes the number of boxes (N), the number of candy requirements (M), a list of box prices (A), and a list of candy requirements (B). 
  - It returns a tuple indicating whether it is possible to satisfy all candy requirements and the total cost if possible.

## Installation

To run the Candy Box program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**:
   The program expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain an integer `N` (the number of boxes).
   - The second line should contain an integer `M` (the number of candy requirements).
   - The third line should contain `N` space-separated integers representing the prices of the boxes.
   - The fourth line should contain `M` space-separated integers representing the minimum candy requirements.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   3
   2
   5 10 15
   6 8
   ```

4. **Output**:
   The program will output either:
   - `possible <total_cost>` if all candy requirements can be satisfied, where `<total_cost>` is the total price of the selected boxes.
   - `impossible` if it is not possible to satisfy all candy requirements.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   possible 15
   ```
