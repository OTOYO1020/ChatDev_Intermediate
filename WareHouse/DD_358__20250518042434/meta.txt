Task:
Define the function 'can_buy_boxes(N: int, M: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> Tuple[bool, int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input values for N, M, A, and B from standard input. Sort the list A (prices and candy pieces) in ascending order. Sort the list B (minimum candy requirements) in ascending order. Initialize a variable 'total_cost' to 0 to keep track of the total price of the selected boxes. Iterate through the sorted list B and for each requirement, find the cheapest box in A that satisfies the candy requirement. If a suitable box is found, add its price to 'total_cost' and mark the box as used (remove it from consideration). If a suitable box cannot be found for any requirement, return (False, 0). If all requirements are satisfied, return (True, total_cost). Output the result in the format 'possible' or 'impossible' followed by the total cost if possible.
