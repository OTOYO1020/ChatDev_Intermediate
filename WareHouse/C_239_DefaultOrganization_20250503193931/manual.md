# Lattice Point Checker

A simple application to determine if there are lattice points that are a distance of \(\sqrt{5}\) from two given coordinates.

## Main Functions

The Lattice Point Checker consists of the following main functions:

1. **Input Coordinates**: The application reads two pairs of coordinates \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) from the user.
2. **Check Lattice Points**: It checks for lattice points that are \(\sqrt{5}\) units away from both sets of coordinates.
3. **Output Result**: The application outputs "YES" if at least one valid lattice point is found, otherwise it outputs "NO".

## Installation

To run the Lattice Point Checker, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

(Note: While the current implementation does not explicitly require external libraries, it's a good practice to have `numpy` for any future enhancements.)

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Coordinates**: When prompted, enter the coordinates in the format `x1,y1` for the first point and `x2,y2` for the second point. For example:

   ```
   Enter coordinates x1, y1 (format: x1,y1, e.g., 1,2): 1,2
   Enter coordinates x2, y2 (format: x2,y2, e.g., 3,4): 3,4
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the coordinates, the application will process the input and display either "YES" or "NO" based on the presence of valid lattice points.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter coordinates x1, y1 (format: x1,y1, e.g., 1,2): 1,2
Enter coordinates x2, y2 (format: x2,y2, e.g., 3,4): 3,4
YES
```

## Edge Cases

- Ensure that the input coordinates are integers.
- The application can handle large coordinate values within the constraints of Python's integer type.

## Conclusion

The Lattice Point Checker is a straightforward tool for checking the existence of lattice points at a specific distance from two given coordinates. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
