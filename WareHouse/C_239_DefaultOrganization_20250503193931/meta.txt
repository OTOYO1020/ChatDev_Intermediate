Task:
Read the coordinates \(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\) from standard input. Define a function 'is_lattice_point(x, y)' to check if the point \((x, y)\) is a lattice point (both coordinates are integers). Calculate the possible coordinates of a lattice point that is \(\sqrt{5}\) units away from \((x_1, y_1)\) using the equation:\n   - \((x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2 = 5\) Identify the integer solutions for the above equation, which can be derived from the pairs \((\pm 2, \pm 1)\) and \((\pm 1, \pm 2)\). For each candidate point derived from step 4, check if it is also \(\sqrt{5}\) units away from \((x_2, y_2)\) using the same distance equation. If a point satisfies both distance conditions, return 'True'; otherwise, return 'False'. Implement the main logic to iterate through all candidate points and check their distances to both \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\). If at least one valid lattice point is found, print YES; otherwise, print NO. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as large coordinate values within the specified constraints. Output the result based on the findings from the checks in step 7.
