Task:
Define the function 'min_frustration(N: int, dislikes: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int' to calculate the minimum possible sum of frustration. Parse the input to extract the number of people 'N' and the list of dislikes 'dislikes' which contains tuples of (Person i, Person X_i) and their corresponding frustration costs. Create a data structure to store the dislikes and their associated frustration costs for each person. Implement a method to determine the order of giving candies that minimizes the total frustration based on the dislikes. Use a graph or similar structure to represent the relationships between people and their dislikes. Apply a sorting or priority mechanism to decide the optimal sequence of giving candies to minimize frustration. Calculate the total frustration based on the chosen sequence and the defined rules of frustration accumulation. Ensure that the solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints (up to 200,000 people). Test the function with various test cases to validate correctness and performance. Return the minimum sum of frustration as an integer output.
