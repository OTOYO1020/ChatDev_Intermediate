Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input, representing the number of departments and the number of employees required for each project. Read the array A of size N, where each element A[i] represents the number of employees in the i-th department. Check if K is greater than N; if so, print 0 and exit, as it's impossible to form a project. Sort the array A in descending order to prioritize departments with more employees. Initialize a variable 'max_projects' to 0 to count the maximum number of projects that can be formed. Loop through the first K departments (from the sorted array A):\n   - For each department, check if it has at least one employee available.\n   - If yes, decrement the employee count for that department by 1 and increment 'max_projects'. Repeat step 6 until no more projects can be formed (i.e., at least one employee is available in each of the K departments). Print the final value of 'max_projects', which represents the maximum number of projects that can be formed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently utilize the available employees across departments while adhering to the constraints provided.
