Define the function 'find_kth_closest_distance(N, Q, A, B, K)' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of points A, Q is the number of points B, A is a list of coordinates for points A, B is a list of coordinates for points B, and K is a list of integers representing k_j values. Parse the input to extract the values of N, Q, the list A of coordinates, the list B of coordinates, and the list K of integers. For each point B_j in the list B, calculate the distances d_i between each point A_i and B_j using the formula d_i = |A_i - B_j|. Store the distances in a list and sort this list to obtain the sorted distances (d_1', d_2', ..., d_N'). Retrieve the k_j-th closest distance from the sorted list of distances for each B_j using the index k_j - 1 (to account for zero-based indexing). Store the results of the k_j-th closest distances for each query B_j in a results list. Implement a loop to repeat the distance calculation and retrieval process for all Q points in B. Ensure that the function handles edge cases such as minimum and maximum values for N and Q, and the range of coordinates for A and B. Return the results list containing the distances for each query B_j. Format the output as a list of integers, each representing the distance for the corresponding B_j.
