Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of reels. Read N strings S_i from standard input, each of length 10, representing the symbols on each reel. Initialize a list 'reel_symbols' to store the characters displayed by each reel for each possible time t (0 to 9). For each reel i (from 0 to N-1):\n   - For each time t (from 0 to 9):\n     - Calculate the displayed character as 'reel_symbols[i][t] = S_i[t]'. Create a dictionary 'symbol_count' to count occurrences of each character (0-9) across all reels for each time t. For each time t (from 0 to 9):\n   - For each character (0-9):\n     - Update 'symbol_count[t][character]' with the number of reels displaying that character at time t. Determine the minimum time t such that there exists a character that appears on all N reels (i.e., 'symbol_count[t][character] == N'). If such a time t is found, store it as 'min_time'; otherwise, indicate that it's impossible. Print the minimum time 'min_time' needed to stop all reels displaying the same character. Handle edge cases where N is less than 2 or if the input strings do not meet the specified constraints.
