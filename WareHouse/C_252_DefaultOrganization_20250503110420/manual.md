# Reel Symbol Matching Software

This software is designed to read symbols from multiple reels and determine the minimum time at which all reels display the same character. It is particularly useful for applications that require synchronization of displayed symbols across multiple sources.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The software reads an integer N representing the number of reels and N strings of length 10, each representing the symbols on a reel.
- **Symbol Management**: It initializes a list to store symbols for each reel and counts occurrences of each character (0-9) across all reels for each time t (0 to 9).
- **Minimum Time Calculation**: The software calculates the minimum time t such that there exists a character that appears on all N reels.
- **Error Handling**: It gracefully handles edge cases, such as invalid input lengths and characters.

## Installation

To run the software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies. For now, it can be empty or include future dependencies as comments:

```
# Future dependencies can be added here
```

### Install Dependencies

You can install any required dependencies using pip. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use the Software

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the software files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the program.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of reels and the symbols for each reel. Ensure that:
   - The number of reels (N) is at least 2.
   - Each symbol string is exactly 10 characters long and contains only digits (0-9).

4. **View Results**: After entering the data, the program will calculate and display the minimum time at which all reels show the same character. If it's impossible, it will indicate that as well.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter number of reels: 3
Enter symbols for each reel (10 characters long): 1234567890
Enter symbols for each reel (10 characters long): 0987654321
Enter symbols for each reel (10 characters long): 1111111111
Minimum time: 1
```

## Error Handling

The software includes error handling for common input issues:

- If the number of reels is less than 2, it will raise an error.
- If any symbol string is not exactly 10 characters long, it will raise an error.
- If any character outside the range of 0-9 is found, it will raise an error.

## Conclusion

This software provides a robust solution for managing and synchronizing symbols across multiple reels. For further enhancements or support, please reach out to the development team.
