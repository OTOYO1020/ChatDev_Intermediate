You are given two integers, N and K, from standard input.Initialize a variable probability to 0. Then, call the function num_twice N times and store the result in the variable num each time.Pass K and each natural number from 1 to N as arguments to the function in that order.Define the function num_twice. Given two natural numbers A and K as arguments, the function should return how many times A must be doubled until it exceeds K.In the loop, update the variable probability by adding the value of 1/N * (1/2)^num.After all iterations are completed, output the value of probability.Ensure that only a single number is printed as the final output.
