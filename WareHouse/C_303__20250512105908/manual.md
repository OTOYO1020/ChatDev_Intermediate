# Takahashi Moves Game

A fun and interactive game where you help Takahashi navigate through a grid while managing his health and collecting items.

## Main Functions

The Takahashi Moves Game includes the following main functions:

- **can_complete_moves(N: int, M: int, H: int, K: int, S: str, items: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool**: This function determines if Takahashi can complete his moves based on the provided parameters. It simulates Takahashi's movements on a grid, checks his health after each move, and restores health when he collects items.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Moves Game, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using `pip` or `conda`. 

### Using pip

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Using conda

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   conda install --file requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use/Play the Game

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.
   - Execute the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Using the GUI**:
   - A window will open prompting you to enter the moves for Takahashi. You can use the characters `R` (Right), `L` (Left), `U` (Up), and `D` (Down) to specify the moves.
   - Enter the grid size in the format `M,N` where `M` is the number of columns and `N` is the number of rows.
   - Click the "Submit" button to see if Takahashi can complete his moves based on the input provided.

3. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Takahashi starts at position (0, 0) with an initial health of `H`.
   - Each move decrements his health by 1.
   - If Takahashi's health drops below 0 at any point, the game will indicate that he cannot complete the moves.
   - If he lands on an item and his health is below `K`, his health will be restored to `K`.

4. **Output**:
   - After submitting the moves, the result will be displayed as "YES" if Takahashi can complete the moves, or "NO" if he cannot.

## Example

- **Input**:
  - Moves: `RRUUD`
  - Grid Size: `5,5`
  
- **Output**:
  - The application will display "YES" or "NO" based on the simulation of Takahashi's moves.
