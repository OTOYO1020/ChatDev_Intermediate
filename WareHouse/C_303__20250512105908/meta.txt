Task:
Define a function 'can_complete_moves(N: int, M: int, H: int, K: int, S: str, items: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool' to determine if Takahashi can complete his moves. Parse the input to extract the values of N, M, H, K, S, and the list of item coordinates (x_i, y_i). Initialize Takahashi's starting position at (0, 0) and set his initial health to H. Iterate through each character in the string S to simulate Takahashi's moves. For each move, update Takahashi's position based on the character (R, L, U, D) and decrement his health by 1. Check if Takahashi's health drops below 0 after each move; if so, return False immediately. If Takahashi's health is still non-negative, check if he has landed on an item and if his health is less than K; if so, restore his health to K. Continue this process for all N moves, keeping track of Takahashi's position and health. If all moves are completed without health dropping below 0, return True. Output the result of the function as 'YES' if Takahashi can complete the moves, otherwise 'NO'.
