Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of buildings. Read the array H of integers, where each H[i] represents the height of the i-th building. Initialize a variable 'max_count' to keep track of the maximum number of buildings that can be chosen. Create a dictionary to store the indices of buildings grouped by their heights. For each unique height in the dictionary:\n   - Retrieve the list of indices where buildings have that height.\n   - Check for all possible intervals between the indices:\n     - For each pair of indices, calculate the common difference (interval).\n     - Count how many buildings can be selected with that interval starting from the first index.\n     - Update 'max_count' if the count exceeds the current maximum. If no buildings are selected, set 'max_count' to 1 (since choosing one building is valid). Print the value of 'max_count' as the final output.
