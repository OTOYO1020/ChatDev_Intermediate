# Building Selection Application

This application allows users to determine the maximum number of buildings that can be selected based on their heights. It reads the number of buildings and their respective heights, then calculates the maximum count of buildings that can be selected based on specific intervals between their indices.

## Main Functions

- **Calculate Maximum Buildings**: The core function of the application that computes the maximum number of buildings that can be selected based on their heights and the intervals between them.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application uses the `collections` module, which is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installations are required. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: 
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the application using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of buildings (N).
   - Next, input the heights of the buildings as a comma-separated list of integers. For example:
     ```
     Enter the number of buildings (N): 5
     Enter the heights (comma-separated integers): 1, 2, 1, 2, 1
     ```

3. **View Output**:
   - The application will process the input and display the maximum number of buildings that can be selected based on the specified criteria.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```plaintext
Enter the number of buildings (N): 6
Enter the heights (comma-separated integers): 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1
```

Output:
```plaintext
4
```

This indicates that a maximum of 4 buildings can be selected based on the heights provided.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for invalid inputs. If the number of buildings does not match the length of the heights provided, or if non-integer values are entered, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

This application is a simple yet effective tool for determining the maximum number of buildings that can be selected based on their heights. It leverages Python's capabilities to handle data efficiently and provides a user-friendly interface for input and output.
