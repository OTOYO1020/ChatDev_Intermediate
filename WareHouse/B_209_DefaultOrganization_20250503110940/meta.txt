Task:
Read integers N and X from standard input. Read the array A of length N, which contains the usual prices of the products. Initialize a variable 'total_cost' to 0 to keep track of the total amount needed to buy all products. Loop through each product index 'i' from 0 to N-1:\n   - If 'i' is even (0-based index), add 'A[i] - 1' to 'total_cost' (applying the discount).\n   - If 'i' is odd, add 'A[i]' to 'total_cost' (no discount). Compare 'total_cost' with X:\n   - If 'total_cost' is less than or equal to X, set 'can_buy' to True.\n   - Otherwise, set 'can_buy' to False. Print 'YES' if 'can_buy' is True, otherwise print 'NO'.
