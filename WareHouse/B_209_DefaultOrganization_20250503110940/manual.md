# Product Purchase Calculator

A simple application to calculate the total cost of products based on their prices, applying discounts for even-indexed products.

## Main Functions

The Product Purchase Calculator performs the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - Prompts the user to enter the number of products (N).
   - Collects the prices for each product.
   - Accepts the user's budget (X).

2. **Cost Calculation**: 
   - Calculates the total cost of products, applying a discount of 1 for products at even indices.

3. **Budget Comparison**: 
   - Compares the total cost with the user's budget and outputs whether the products can be purchased within the budget.

4. **Input Validation**: 
   - Ensures that all inputs are positive integers greater than zero.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Product Purchase Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: 
   - Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Clone the repository containing the application files:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd <repository-directory>
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install any required dependencies (if specified in `requirements.txt`):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: 
   - Execute the main application file:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**: 
   - Enter the number of products when prompted.
   - Input the price for each product as requested.
   - Provide your budget when prompted.

3. **View the Result**: 
   - After entering all the required information, the application will calculate the total cost and display "YES" if the total cost is within your budget, or "NO" if it exceeds your budget.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of products (N): 3
Enter price for product 1: 10
Enter price for product 2: 20
Enter price for product 3: 30
Enter your budget (X): 50
YES
```

In this example, the total cost is calculated as follows:
- Product 1 (even index): 10 - 1 = 9
- Product 2 (odd index): 20
- Product 3 (even index): 30 - 1 = 29
- Total Cost = 9 + 20 + 29 = 58, which exceeds the budget of 50, hence the output is "NO".
