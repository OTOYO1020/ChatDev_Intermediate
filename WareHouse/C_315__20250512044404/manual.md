# Max Satisfaction Application

Calculate the maximum satisfaction from a selection of flavored cups based on their deliciousness.

## Overview

The Max Satisfaction application allows users to determine the maximum satisfaction achievable by selecting pairs of cups based on their flavors and deliciousness values. The application efficiently handles large inputs, making it suitable for scenarios with up to 300,000 cups.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of cups, flavors, and deliciousness values from standard input.
- **Satisfaction Calculation**: Computes satisfaction based on the following rules:
  - For pairs of cups with different flavors: Satisfaction is calculated as `s + t`, where `s` and `t` are the deliciousness values of the selected cups.
  - For pairs of cups with the same flavor: Satisfaction is calculated as `s + t / 2`, where `s` is the higher deliciousness value and `t` is the lower deliciousness value.
- **Output Handling**: Prints the maximum satisfaction value as an integer.

## Installation

To run the Max Satisfaction application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`. 

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: If there are no specific dependencies, you can skip this step.)*

## Usage

1. **Prepare Input**: The input should consist of:
   - An integer `N` representing the number of cups.
   - A list of integers representing the flavors of the cups.
   - A list of integers representing the deliciousness of the cups.

   The input format should be as follows:
   ```
   N
   flavor1,flavor2,...,flavorN
   deliciousness1,deliciousness2,...,deliciousnessN
   ```

   Example input:
   ```
   5
   1,2,1,2,3
   10,20,30,40,50
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` script to calculate the maximum satisfaction:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Output**: The application will print the maximum satisfaction value to the console.

## Example

Given the following input:
```
5
1,2,1,2,3
10,20,30,40,50
```

The output will be:
```
90
```

This indicates that the maximum satisfaction calculated from the provided flavors and deliciousness values is 90.

## Performance

The algorithm is designed to efficiently handle the upper limit of `N` (up to 300,000) to avoid performance issues. It uses a combination of data structures and algorithms to ensure that satisfaction calculations are performed in a timely manner.
