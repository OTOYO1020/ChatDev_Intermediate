Task:
Define the function 'max_satisfaction(N: int, flavors: List[int], deliciousness: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the number of cups, 'flavors' is a list of integers representing the flavors of the cups, and 'deliciousness' is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of the cups. Implement input handling to read integers 'N', followed by two lists: 'flavors' and 'deliciousness' from standard input. Create a data structure to store the deliciousness values grouped by their respective flavors for efficient access. Iterate through all pairs of cups to calculate the satisfaction based on the given conditions (different flavors vs same flavor). For pairs with different flavors, calculate satisfaction as 's + t' where 's' and 't' are the deliciousness values of the selected cups. For pairs with the same flavor, calculate satisfaction as 's + t / 2' where 's' is the higher deliciousness value and 't' is the lower deliciousness value. Keep track of the maximum satisfaction encountered during the iteration through pairs of cups. Ensure that the algorithm efficiently handles the upper limit of 'N' (up to 300,000) to avoid performance issues. Return the maximum satisfaction value from the function. Implement output handling to print the maximum satisfaction value as an integer.
