Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of balls. Read the array A of length N, containing the integers written on each ball. Initialize an empty dictionary 'count' to store the frequency of each integer in A. Populate the 'count' dictionary by iterating through the array A to count occurrences of each integer. For each k from 1 to N:\n   - Temporarily remove the k-th ball's integer from the 'count' dictionary.\n   - Calculate the number of ways to choose two distinct balls with equal integers from the remaining N-1 balls:\n     - For each integer in 'count', if its frequency is 'f', add 'f * (f - 1) / 2' to a variable 'ways' to account for combinations of two balls.\n   - Restore the k-th ball's integer back to the 'count' dictionary. Store the result for each k in an array 'results'. Print the results array, which contains the number of ways for each k.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that we efficiently compute the required values while adhering to the constraints provided.
