# Ball Counting Application

A simple application to calculate the number of ways to choose two distinct balls with equal integers after removing each ball one at a time.

## Main Functions

The Ball Counting Application consists of the following main functions:

1. **count_frequencies(A)**: This function takes an array of integers (A) and counts the frequency of each integer, returning a dictionary with the counts.

2. **calculate_ways(count)**: This function calculates the number of ways to choose two distinct balls with equal integers based on the frequency dictionary provided.

3. **main()**: The main entry point of the application. It reads user input, processes the data, and prints the results.

## Installation

To run the Ball Counting Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any additional libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

2. **Execute the Program**: Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Number of Balls**: When prompted, enter the integer N, which represents the number of balls.

4. **Input the Integers on the Balls**: Enter the integers written on each ball, separated by commas. For example:
   ```
   1,2,2,3,3,3
   ```

5. **View the Results**: The application will output the number of ways to choose two distinct balls with equal integers for each ball removed.

## Example Usage

```
Enter number of balls (N): 6
Enter integers on balls (comma-separated): 1,2,2,3,3,3
Ways to choose two distinct balls:
3
2
2
1
1
0
```

In this example, the user has entered 6 balls with the integers 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 3. The application calculates and displays the number of ways to choose two distinct balls with equal integers after removing each ball one at a time.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to analyze combinations of balls based on their integer values. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the support team.
