Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers. Read the N integers \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N \) into an array 'A'. Initialize a variable 'max_value' to find the maximum value in the array 'A'. Loop through the array 'A' to determine the largest integer that is not equal to 'max_value':\n   - Initialize a variable 'second_max' to a very small value (or negative infinity).\n   - For each integer \( A_i \) in 'A':\n     - If \( A_i \) is less than 'max_value' and greater than 'second_max', update 'second_max' with \( A_i \). After the loop, 'second_max' will hold the largest integer that is not the largest. Print the value of 'second_max' as the result.\n\nThe function to implement this logic could be named 'find_second_largest(N, A)' where 'N' is the number of integers and 'A' is the list of integers. The output format will be a single integer representing the largest integer that is not the largest.
