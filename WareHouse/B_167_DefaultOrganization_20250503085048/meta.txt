Task:
Read integers A, B, C, and K from standard input. Initialize a variable 'max_sum' to 0 to store the maximum possible sum. Determine the number of cards to pick from each type:\n   - Set 'pick_from_A' to the minimum of A and K (the number of cards with 1).\n   - Set 'remaining_K' to K - 'pick_from_A'. If 'remaining_K' is greater than 0, determine how many cards to pick from B (the number of cards with 0):\n   - Set 'pick_from_B' to the minimum of B and 'remaining_K'.\n   - Update 'remaining_K' to K - 'pick_from_A' - 'pick_from_B'. If 'remaining_K' is still greater than 0, determine how many cards to pick from C (the number of cards with -1):\n   - Set 'pick_from_C' to the minimum of C and 'remaining_K'. Calculate the maximum sum using the formula:\n   - 'max_sum = (pick_from_A * 1) + (pick_from_B * 0) + (pick_from_C * -1)'. Print the value of 'max_sum'.
