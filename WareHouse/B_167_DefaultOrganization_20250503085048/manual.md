# Max Sum Calculator

A simple application to calculate the maximum possible sum based on the number of cards picked from different types.

## Overview

This software allows users to input the number of cards of three types (A, B, and C) and a total number of cards (K) to pick. The application calculates the maximum sum based on the values of the cards:
- Cards of type A have a value of 1.
- Cards of type B have a value of 0.
- Cards of type C have a value of -1.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads integers A, B, C, and K from standard input.
- **Calculation**: It determines how many cards to pick from each type to maximize the sum.
- **Output**: The application prints the calculated maximum sum.

## Installation

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Setup

1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Install Dependencies**: No additional dependencies are required for this application.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
2. **Execute the Script**: Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the values for A, B, C, and K. For example:
   ```
   Enter A: 5
   Enter B: 3
   Enter C: 2
   Enter K: 6
   ```
4. **View Result**: After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the maximum sum:
   ```
   Max Sum: 5
   ```

## Example Usage

- If you have 5 cards of type A, 3 cards of type B, 2 cards of type C, and you want to pick a total of 6 cards, the application will calculate the maximum sum based on the optimal selection of cards.

## Additional Notes

- The application currently does not require any external libraries or frameworks.
- Ensure that the input values are non-negative integers.
