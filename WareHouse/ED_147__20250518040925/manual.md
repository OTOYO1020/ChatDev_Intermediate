# Min Unbalancedness Calculator

A Python application to calculate the minimum unbalancedness between two grids.

## Overview

The Min Unbalancedness Calculator allows users to input two grids of integers and computes the minimum unbalancedness based on the defined paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grids. The unbalancedness is calculated as the absolute difference between the sums of two colored paths through the grids.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of rows (H) and columns (W) and the two grids (A and B) from standard input.
- **Path Exploration**: The software explores all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, calculating unbalancedness for each path.
- **Minimum Calculation**: It tracks and returns the minimum unbalancedness found during the exploration.

## Installation

To run the Min Unbalancedness Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of rows and columns, and then input the grids:
   - Enter the number of rows (H).
   - Enter the number of columns (W).
   - Input grid A as space-separated integers for each row.
   - Input grid B similarly.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of rows (H): 2
   Enter the number of columns (W): 2
   Enter grid A (space-separated rows):
   1 2
   3 4
   Enter grid B (space-separated rows):
   5 6
   7 8
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After inputting the grids, the application will compute and display the minimum unbalancedness.
   ```
   Minimum Unbalancedness: <calculated_value>
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to run the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter the number of rows (H): 2
Enter the number of columns (W): 2
Enter grid A (space-separated rows):
1 2
3 4
Enter grid B (space-separated rows):
5 6
7 8
Minimum Unbalancedness: 0
```

## Conclusion

The Min Unbalancedness Calculator is a straightforward tool for computing the minimum unbalancedness between two grids. By following the steps outlined above, users can easily input their data and receive results efficiently.
