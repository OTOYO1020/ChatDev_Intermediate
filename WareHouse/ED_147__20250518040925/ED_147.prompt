Define the function 'min_unbalancedness(H: int, W: int, A: List[List[int]], B: List[List[int]])' to handle the input parameters where H is the number of rows, W is the number of columns, and A and B are 2D lists representing the numbers on the grid. Implement input handling to read H and W, followed by reading the 2D lists A and B from standard input. Initialize a variable 'min_unbalanced' to store the minimum unbalancedness found during the computation. Create a recursive function or dynamic programming approach to explore all possible paths from (1, 1) to (H, W) while calculating the unbalancedness for each path. For each square (i, j), decide whether to paint A[i][j] red and B[i][j] blue or vice versa, and update the current sums of red and blue numbers accordingly. Ensure that the movement is constrained to either down (i+1, j) or right (i, j+1) and does not exceed the grid boundaries. Calculate the unbalancedness as the absolute difference between the total red and total blue sums along the path taken. Update 'min_unbalanced' if the current unbalancedness is less than the previously recorded minimum. Return the value of 'min_unbalanced' after exploring all possible paths. Print the output in the required format, which is the minimum unbalancedness found.
