Task:
Read integers N and Q from standard input. Initialize an array 'balls' of size N with values from 1 to N, representing the initial state of the balls. For each operation from 1 to Q:\n   - Read the integer 'x_i' from input.\n   - Determine the index of the ball with the integer 'x_i' in the 'balls' array.\n   - If the index is not the last index (N-1), swap the ball at that index with the ball at the next index (index + 1).\n   - If the index is the last index (N-1), swap the ball at that index with the ball at the previous index (index - 1). After processing all operations, the 'balls' array will represent the final state of the balls. Print the values in the 'balls' array as the output.
