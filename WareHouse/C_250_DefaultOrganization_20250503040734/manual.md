# Ball Swap Application

A simple application to manage and swap the positions of balls based on user-defined operations.

## Overview

The Ball Swap application allows users to initialize an array of balls numbered from 1 to N and perform a series of operations to swap the positions of these balls. The application reads integers N (number of balls) and Q (number of operations) from the user, processes the operations, and outputs the final arrangement of the balls.

## Main Functions

- **Initialize Balls**: Creates an array of balls numbered from 1 to N.
- **Swap Balls**: For each operation, the application swaps the position of a specified ball with its neighbor based on its current position.
- **Output Final State**: After processing all operations, the application prints the final arrangement of the balls.

## Installation

To run the Ball Swap application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies required, you can install them using pip. For this application, no external libraries are needed, but ensure you have Python's standard library.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Balls (N)**: When prompted, enter the number of balls you want to manage (N). This should be a positive integer.

3. **Input the Number of Operations (Q)**: Next, enter the number of operations you want to perform (Q). This should also be a positive integer.

4. **Input the Operations**: Enter the operations as space-separated integers. Each integer represents the ball you want to swap.

5. **View the Output**: After processing all operations, the application will print the final arrangement of the balls.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of balls (N): 5
Enter the number of operations (Q): 3
Enter 3 operations (space-separated): 1 3 5
```

**Output**:
```
2 1 4 5 3
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-positive integer for N or Q, the application will raise an error and prompt you to enter valid values.
- If you attempt to swap a ball that is not in the range of 1 to N, the application will print a warning and skip that operation.

## Conclusion

The Ball Swap application is a straightforward tool for managing and swapping the positions of balls based on user-defined operations. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear error messages to guide users in case of incorrect input.
