Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of types of beans. Initialize a dictionary 'color_map' to store lists of deliciousness values for each color. For i from 1 to N:\n   - Read the deliciousness A_i and color C_i for each bean.\n   - Append A_i to the list in 'color_map' corresponding to color C_i. For each color in 'color_map', compute the minimum deliciousness of beans of that color and store these values in a list 'min_deliciousness'. Identify the maximum value from the 'min_deliciousness' list, which represents the optimal color choice. Print the maximum minimum deliciousness value.
