# Bean Deliciousness Calculator

A simple application to calculate the maximum minimum deliciousness of beans based on their color.

## Quick Install

To run the Bean Deliciousness Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## ü§î What is this?

The Bean Deliciousness Calculator allows users to input various types of beans, each with a deliciousness value and a color. The application processes this data to determine the optimal color choice based on the maximum of the minimum deliciousness values for each color.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Bean Data**: Users can input the number of bean types and their corresponding deliciousness values and colors.
2. **Calculate Maximum Minimum Deliciousness**: The application computes the maximum of the minimum deliciousness values for each color.
3. **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling for user inputs, ensuring that only valid data is processed.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the `main.py` script in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Beans**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of types of beans (a positive integer).

3. **Input Bean Details**:
   - For each bean, input the deliciousness value (an integer) and the color (a non-empty string) separated by a space. For example:
   ```
   10 red
   ```

4. **Handle Input Errors**:
   - If you enter invalid data (e.g., a negative number, non-integer for deliciousness, or empty color), the application will prompt you to re-enter the data, providing up to three attempts before terminating.

5. **View Results**:
   - After entering all beans, the application will compute and display the maximum minimum deliciousness value.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of types of beans (positive integer): 3
Enter deliciousness (integer) and color (non-empty string) separated by space: 10 red
Enter deliciousness (integer) and color (non-empty string) separated by space: 5 blue
Enter deliciousness (integer) and color (non-empty string) separated by space: 7 red
Maximum Minimum Deliciousness: 7
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `collections` module (included in the Python standard library)

## üìÑ Code Structure

The application consists of two main files:

1. **main.py**: The main application file that handles user input and orchestrates the calculation.
2. **bean_handler.py**: A module that manages the bean data processing, including adding beans and computing the maximum minimum deliciousness.

## Conclusion

The Bean Deliciousness Calculator is a straightforward tool for evaluating bean deliciousness based on color. With its user-friendly interface and error handling, it ensures a smooth experience for users. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to our support team.
