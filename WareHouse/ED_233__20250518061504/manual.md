# Sum Calculator

A simple application to calculate the cumulative sum of the floor division of an integer by powers of ten.

## Main Functions

The Sum Calculator provides the following main functions:

- **calculate_sum(X)**: This function takes an integer `X` as input and calculates the cumulative sum of `floor(X / 10^k)` for `k` ranging from 0 to 100. It returns the total sum after completing the calculations.

## Quick Install

To run the Sum Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Currently, there are no additional dependencies required for this application.*

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository containing the Sum Calculator code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input an Integer**: When prompted, enter an integer value. The application will then calculate the cumulative sum based on the input.

4. **View the Result**: After processing, the application will display the total sum calculated.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter an integer: 12345
Total Sum: 135
```

## Error Handling

- If a non-integer value is entered, the application will prompt the user to enter a valid integer.

```plaintext
Enter an integer: abc
Please enter a valid integer.
```

## Additional Information

- The application handles negative integers by returning a sum of 0.
- The calculation of `10^k` is optimized to avoid unnecessary computations when the power exceeds the input integer `X`.
