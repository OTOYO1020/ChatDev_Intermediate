Define a function named 'calculate_sum(X)' that takes an integer 'X' as input. Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to store the cumulative sum. Implement a loop that iterates 'k' from 0 to 100 (inclusive). In each iteration, calculate 'floor(X / 10^k)' and add the result to 'total_sum'. Ensure that the calculation of '10^k' does not exceed the limits of integer representation. Return the value of 'total_sum' after the loop completes. Handle the input format to read the integer 'X' from standard input. Convert the input string to an integer before passing it to the 'calculate_sum' function. Call the 'calculate_sum(X)' function with the parsed integer 'X'. Print the output of 'calculate_sum(X)' as the final result.
