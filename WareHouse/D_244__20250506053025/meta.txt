Task:
Read the input string 'S' representing the current hat colors of Takahashis 1, 2, and 3. Read the input string 'T' representing the desired hat colors for Takahashis 1, 2, and 3. Verify that both 'S' and 'T' are permutations of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. Since the operation allows any two Takahashis to exchange hats, determine if the desired configuration 'T' can be achieved from the current configuration 'S' through any number of exchanges. Check if the counts of each color in 'S' match the counts in 'T' (which they will, since both are permutations). Since any configuration can be reached through sufficient exchanges, conclude that it is always possible to achieve the desired configuration. Return YES if the desired configuration can be achieved, otherwise return NO. Print the result.\n\nIn this case, since the operations allow for complete freedom of exchanges, the answer will always be YES if the input conditions are met.
