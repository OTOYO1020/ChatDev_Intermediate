Task:
Read the integer Q from standard input, which represents the number of queries. Initialize an empty bag (data structure) to store the integers written on the balls. Initialize a set or dictionary to keep track of the unique integers in the bag. Loop through each query from 1 to Q:\n   - Read the query type and the associated integer (if applicable).\n   - If the query type is '1 x':\n     - Add the integer x to the bag.\n     - Update the set/dictionary of unique integers.\n   - If the query type is '2 x':\n     - Remove the integer x from the bag.\n     - Update the set/dictionary of unique integers accordingly.\n   - If the query type is '3':\n     - Print the count of unique integers in the bag. Ensure that the operations for adding and removing integers are efficient (e.g., using a dictionary or set). Handle input and output efficiently to accommodate the upper limits of Q (up to 200,000). Ensure that the bag's state is correctly maintained throughout the processing of queries. Validate that the constraints are respected, particularly for the second type of query where the integer x must exist in the bag. Use appropriate data structures to ensure that the operations (add, remove, count unique) are performed in optimal time complexity. Print the results for all type '3' queries in the order they were requested.
