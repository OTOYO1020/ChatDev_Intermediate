## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**‚ùì Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**ü§ñ Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## Introduction

The LangChain software is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of integers that satisfy a given condition in a sequence. It takes two sequences of non-negative integers as input and finds the number of integers that satisfy the condition. The software also allows for updating the elements of the sequences and multiplying the elements of a subsequence by a positive real number.

## Installation

To install the LangChain software, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install langchain
   ```

   or

   ```
   conda install langchain -c conda-forge
   ```

3. Once the installation is complete, you can import the LangChain module in your Python code.

## Usage

To use the LangChain software, follow these steps:

1. Import the LangChain module in your Python code:

   ```python
   import langchain
   ```

2. Create an instance of the LangChain class:

   ```python
   lc = langchain.LangChain()
   ```

3. Load the data from a file:

   ```python
   lc.load_data("input.txt")
   ```

4. Process the data and find the number of matches:

   ```python
   result = lc.process_data()
   ```

5. Save the result to a file:

   ```python
   lc.save_data("output.txt")
   ```

6. The number of matches can be accessed using the `matches` attribute of the LangChain instance:

   ```python
   print(f"Number of matches: {lc.matches}")
   ```

7. You can also update the elements of the sequences and multiply the elements of a subsequence by a positive real number using the provided utility functions:

   ```python
   updated_sequence = langchain.function1(sequence)
   multiplied_sequence = langchain.function2(sequence, t)
   ```

   where `sequence` is a list of non-negative integers and `t` is a positive real number.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the LangChain software:

```python
import langchain

# Create an instance of the LangChain class
lc = langchain.LangChain()

# Load the data from a file
lc.load_data("input.txt")

# Process the data and find the number of matches
result = lc.process_data()

# Save the result to a file
lc.save_data("output.txt")

# Print the number of matches
print(f"Number of matches: {lc.matches}")
```

## Conclusion

The LangChain software provides a convenient way to find the number of integers that satisfy a given condition in a sequence. It allows for updating the elements of the sequences and multiplying the elements of a subsequence by a positive real number. By following the installation and usage instructions provided in this manual, you can easily use the LangChain software to solve your problem.
