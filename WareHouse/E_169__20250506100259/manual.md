# Median Calculator

A simple application for calculating the number of distinct median values based on user-defined pairs of integers.

## Overview

The Median Calculator allows users to input a number of pairs of integers, representing lower and upper bounds. The application then calculates how many distinct median values can be derived from these bounds. This is particularly useful in statistical analysis and data processing where understanding the range of potential median values is important.

## Main Functions

- **Input Pairs**: Users can enter a specified number of pairs of integers (A_i, B_i) where A_i is the lower bound and B_i is the upper bound.
- **Calculate Distinct Medians**: The application computes the number of distinct median values that can be formed from the provided pairs.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling to ensure valid input and provide user-friendly error messages.

## Installation

To run the Median Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```

   This command installs the Tkinter library, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

## How to Use the Median Calculator

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to launch the Median Calculator application. You can do this by navigating to the directory where `main.py` is located and running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Pairs**: In the application window, enter the number of pairs (N) you wish to input.

3. **Enter Pairs of Integers**: In the text area, input each pair of integers (A_i, B_i) on a new line. Ensure that each line contains exactly two integers separated by a space, and that A_i is less than or equal to B_i.

   Example input for 3 pairs:
   ```
   1 5
   2 6
   3 7
   ```

4. **Calculate the Median**: Click the "Calculate Median" button. The application will process the input and display the number of distinct median values below the button.

5. **Error Handling**: If there are any issues with your input (e.g., invalid integers, incorrect number of pairs), the application will display an appropriate error message.

## Example Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Enter `3` for the number of pairs.
3. Input the following pairs:
   ```
   1 5
   2 6
   3 7
   ```
4. Click "Calculate Median" to see the result.

## Conclusion

The Median Calculator is a straightforward tool for statistical analysis, providing users with the ability to quickly determine the range of potential median values from a set of integer pairs. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
