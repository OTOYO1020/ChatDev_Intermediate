Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers. Initialize two lists, 'A' and 'B', to store the lower and upper bounds for each integer, respectively. Read N pairs of integers (A_i, B_i) from standard input and populate the lists 'A' and 'B'. Create a list 'X' to store the possible values for each integer, where each value can range from A[i] to B[i]. Sort the lists 'A' and 'B' to facilitate the calculation of possible median values. Determine the number of distinct values that the median can take based on the sorted values:\n   - If N is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted list.\n   - If N is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. Calculate the range of possible values for the median based on the sorted lists:\n   - For odd N, find the range for the middle element.\n   - For even N, find the range for the two middle elements. Count the number of distinct median values that can be formed from the calculated ranges. Print the count of distinct median values.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function: 'count_distinct_median(N, A, B)'\n- Variables: 'X', 'median_count', 'sorted_A', 'sorted_B' \n\n### Input Format:\n- The input consists of an integer N followed by N pairs of integers (A_i, B_i).\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output is a single integer representing the number of different values that the median can take.
