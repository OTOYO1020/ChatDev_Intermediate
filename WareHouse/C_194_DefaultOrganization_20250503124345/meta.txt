Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the sequence A. Read the sequence of integers A of length N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'sum_squared_differences' to 0 to store the cumulative sum of squared differences. Use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of indices (i, j) where \(1 \leq j < i \leq N\).\n   - For each pair, calculate the squared difference \((A[i] - A[j])^2\).\n   - Update 'sum_squared_differences' by adding the squared difference. After completing the nested loop, print the value of 'sum_squared_differences'.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to be implemented: 'calculate_sum_squared_differences(N, A)'\n- Variables: 'N', 'A', 'sum_squared_differences', 'i', 'j', 'squared_difference' (for the squared difference calculation). \n\n### Input and Output Format:\n- Input: The first line contains the integer N, followed by N integers representing the sequence A.\n- Output: A single integer representing the sum of squared differences.
