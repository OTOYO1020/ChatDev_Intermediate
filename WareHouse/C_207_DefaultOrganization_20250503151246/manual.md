# Interval Intersection Checker

A Python application for checking intersections between various types of intervals.

## Quick Install

To run the Interval Intersection Checker, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies if you have any additional libraries.

## 🤔 What is this?

The Interval Intersection Checker allows users to input a series of intervals defined by their types and endpoints. The software then checks for intersections between these intervals based on their definitions. The types of intervals supported are:

- **Type 1**: Closed interval `[l, r]`
- **Type 2**: Left-closed interval `[l, r)`
- **Type 3**: Right-closed interval `(l, r]`
- **Type 4**: Open interval `(l, r)`

## 📖 Main Functions

### 1. Input Intervals

The application prompts the user to enter the number of intervals and their respective details. For each interval, the user must provide:

- `t`: Type of interval (1 to 4)
- `l`: Left endpoint of the interval
- `r`: Right endpoint of the interval

### 2. Check Intersections

Once the intervals are entered, the application checks for intersections between all pairs of intervals and outputs the count of intersecting pairs.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Enter Number of Intervals**: When prompted, enter a positive integer representing the number of intervals you want to check.

3. **Input Interval Details**: For each interval, input the type and endpoints in the following format:

   ```
   t l r
   ```

   For example, to input a closed interval from 1 to 5, you would enter:

   ```
   1 1 5
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering all intervals, the application will display the number of intersecting pairs.

## 🛠️ Example Usage

Here's an example of how the input might look:

```
Enter number of intervals: 3
Enter interval 1 (t, l, r) separated by spaces: 1 1 5
Enter interval 2 (t, l, r) separated by spaces: 2 4 6
Enter interval 3 (t, l, r) separated by spaces: 3 5 10
```

The output will display the number of intersecting pairs based on the intervals provided.
