Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of intervals. Initialize a list 'intervals' to store the intervals. For each interval from 1 to N:\n   - Read the values of 't_i', 'l_i', and 'r_i' from standard input.\n   - Based on the value of 't_i', create the interval as follows:\n     - If 't_i = 1', store as '[l_i, r_i]'.\n     - If 't_i = 2', store as '[l_i, r_i)'.\n     - If 't_i = 3', store as '(l_i, r_i]'.\n     - If 't_i = 4', store as '(l_i, r_i)'. Define a function 'do_intervals_intersect(interval1, interval2)' that checks if two intervals intersect based on their definitions. Initialize a counter 'count' to zero for counting intersecting pairs. Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of intervals '(i, j)' where '1 ≤ i < j ≤ N':\n   - Call 'do_intervals_intersect(intervals[i], intervals[j])' to check for intersection.\n   - If they intersect, increment 'count'. Print the final value of 'count', which represents the number of intersecting pairs of intervals.
