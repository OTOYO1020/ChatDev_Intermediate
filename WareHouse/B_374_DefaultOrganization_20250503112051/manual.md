# String Comparison Application

A simple application for comparing two strings and determining their differences.

## Main Functions

The String Comparison Application provides the following functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Prompts the user to enter two non-empty strings.
- **String Comparison**: Compares the two strings character by character and identifies:
  - The position of the first mismatch.
  - If the strings are equal.
  - If one string is a prefix of the other.
- **Output**: Displays the result of the comparison in a user-friendly format.

## Quick Install

To run the String Comparison Application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install any necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: Currently, there are no external dependencies required for this application, but this command is included for future scalability.)

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the repository containing the application files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: 
   Execute the main application file to start the string comparison process.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Strings**: 
   When prompted, enter the first string followed by the second string. Ensure that both strings are non-empty.

   ```
   Enter the first string: hello
   Enter the second string: hello world
   ```

4. **View Results**: 
   The application will output the result of the comparison:
   - If the strings are equal, it will print "The strings are equal."
   - If there is a mismatch, it will print the position of the first mismatch.
   - If one string is a prefix of the other, it will indicate the position after the shorter string.

   Example output for the above input:
   ```
   Result: 6
   ```

## Edge Cases Handled

- The application checks for empty strings and prompts the user to re-enter valid strings if either input is empty.
- It correctly identifies and handles cases where one string is a prefix of the other.

## Conclusion

The String Comparison Application is a straightforward tool for comparing two strings, useful for various applications in programming and data processing. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
