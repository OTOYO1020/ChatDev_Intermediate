# Matrix Sorter

A Python application for checking if a matrix can be sorted based on specific conditions.

## Main Functions

The Matrix Sorter application provides the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads matrix dimensions (H and W) and the matrix itself from user input.
2. **Zero Replacement**: Replaces any element in the matrix that is 0 with a unique positive integer.
3. **Sorting Check**: Determines if the matrix can be sorted according to the specified conditions:
   - For every pair of rows, if row index `i` is less than `i'`, then for all valid column indices `j`, `A[i][j]` must be less than or equal to `A[i'][j]`.
   - For every pair of columns in the same row, if column index `j` is less than `j'`, then for all valid row indices `i`, `A[i][j]` must be less than or equal to `A[i][j']`.

## Installation

To run the Matrix Sorter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Matrix Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the dimensions of the matrix (H for rows and W for columns) separated by a space. For example:

   ```
   Enter matrix dimensions (H W): 3 3
   ```

3. **Input Matrix Rows**: Next, enter each row of the matrix, with integers separated by spaces. Make sure to enter exactly W integers for each row. For example:

   ```
   Enter matrix rows (space-separated):
   1 0 3
   4 5 0
   0 7 8
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the matrix, the application will process it and output whether the matrix can be sorted according to the specified conditions:

   ```
   The matrix can be sorted.
   ```

   or

   ```
   The matrix cannot be sorted.
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the dimensions H and W are not positive integers, an error message will be displayed.
- If the number of integers in any row does not match the specified number of columns W, an error message will be displayed.
- Any unexpected errors will also be caught and displayed.

## Conclusion

The Matrix Sorter application is a simple yet effective tool for checking the sortability of matrices based on specific conditions. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or to extend its functionality.
