# Count Numbers with Exactly 9 Divisors

This software provides a utility to calculate the number of positive integers not greater than a given number \( N \) that have exactly 9 positive divisors. It utilizes mathematical properties of numbers and prime number generation to achieve this.

## Main Functions

1. **`count_numbers_with_n_divisors(N: int, d: int) -> int`**
   - This is the main function that takes an integer \( N \) and the number of divisors \( d \) (which is 9 in this case) as input.
   - It calculates and returns the count of positive integers not greater than \( N \) that have exactly 9 positive divisors.

2. **`is_prime(num: int) -> bool`**
   - A helper function that checks if a number is prime.
   - It is used internally to find prime numbers up to a certain limit.

3. **`sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit: int) -> list`**
   - This function generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

## Mathematical Properties

Numbers with exactly 9 divisors can be of two forms:
- \( p^8 \): where \( p \) is a prime number.
- \( p^2 \times q^2 \): where \( p \) and \( q \) are distinct prime numbers.

## Installation

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install math
```

(Note: The `math` module is part of the Python standard library and does not require installation, but it's listed here for clarity.)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the code:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. Use the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Value of N**

   When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \). The program will then calculate and display the count of numbers with exactly 9 divisors that are less than or equal to \( N \).

   Example:
   ```
   Enter a number (N): 100
   Count of numbers with exactly 9 divisors: 3
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the application works:

1. Start the application.
2. Input a number, for example, `100`.
3. The application will output the count of numbers with exactly 9 divisors that are less than or equal to `100`.

## Conclusion

This software provides a straightforward way to explore the properties of numbers with exactly 9 divisors. By leveraging prime number generation and mathematical insights, it efficiently counts the relevant integers up to a specified limit.
