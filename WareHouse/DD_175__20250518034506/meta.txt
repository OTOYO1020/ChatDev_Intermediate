Task:
Define the function 'max_score(N: int, K: int, C: List[int], P: List[int])' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of squares, K is the maximum number of moves, C is the list of scores on each square, and P is the permutation of squares. Initialize a variable 'max_score' to 0 to keep track of the maximum score. Iterate through each square 'i' from 1 to N to simulate starting the game from that square. For each starting square 'i', initialize a variable 'current_score' to 0 and a variable 'current_position' to 'i'. Create a set to track visited squares to detect cycles during the moves. Perform a loop to simulate the moves up to K times or until a cycle is detected, updating 'current_score' and 'current_position' accordingly. If a cycle is detected, calculate the score gained in one complete cycle and determine how many full cycles can be performed within the remaining moves. Update 'max_score' with the maximum value between the current score and the score after completing cycles. After iterating through all starting squares, return the value of 'max_score'. Ensure the output format is a single integer representing the maximum possible score.
