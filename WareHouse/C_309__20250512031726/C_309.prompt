Define a function 'first_day_with_k_or_less_pills(N: int, K: int, days: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int' that takes the number of medicine types, the threshold K, and a list of tuples representing (a_i, b_i) for each medicine. Parse the input to extract the values of N, K, and the list of (a_i, b_i) pairs from the input format. Initialize a list 'pills_per_day' of size equal to the maximum day calculated from the input to keep track of the total pills Takahashi has to take each day. Iterate over each medicine type and for each (a_i, b_i) pair, update the 'pills_per_day' list to reflect the number of pills taken on each day from day 1 to day a_i. After populating the 'pills_per_day' list, iterate through the list to find the first day where the number of pills is less than or equal to K. Return the index of the first day found in the previous step as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when K is 0 or when no day meets the criteria. Implement input validation to ensure that all input values are within the specified constraints. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the 'first_day_with_k_or_less_pills' function against various test cases. Format the output to return the day number as an integer.
