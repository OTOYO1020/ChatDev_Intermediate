Define the function 'find_visited_cities(N: int, roads: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the number of cities and 'roads' is a list of tuples representing the connections between cities. Parse the input to extract the number of cities 'N' and the list of roads 'roads' from the input format. Construct an adjacency list 'graph' to represent the bidirectional roads connecting the cities. Initialize a list 'visited' to keep track of the cities that have been visited and a stack 'stack' to manage the current path of cities. Implement the logic to traverse the cities starting from City 1, following the rules of visiting unvisited directly connected cities in ascending order. If there are no unvisited directly connected cities, check if the current city is City 1; if so, end the journey, otherwise backtrack to the previous city. Record the order of cities visited in a list 'visited_order' as Takahashi travels through the cities. Ensure that the function handles the constraints of the problem, particularly the maximum number of cities and roads. Return the list 'visited_order' from the function as the output of the journey. Format the output to match the required output format, which is a list of integers representing the sequence of visited cities.
