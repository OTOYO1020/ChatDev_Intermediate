# City Traversal Application

A Python application designed to traverse a network of cities based on user-defined connections (roads) and return the order of visited cities.

## Main Functions

- **CityGraph Class**: Represents the graph of cities and handles the traversal logic.
- **find_visited_cities(N: int, roads: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]**: This function takes the number of cities and a list of roads, constructs an adjacency list, and returns the order of cities visited starting from City 1.

## Quick Install

To run the City Traversal Application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: The `requirements.txt` file should include any necessary libraries, such as `tkinter` for the GUI.*

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The City Traversal Application allows users to input a number of cities and the roads connecting them. The application will then simulate a traversal starting from City 1, visiting cities in ascending order based on their connections. The result will be displayed as a list of visited cities.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: Enter the number of cities and the list of roads in the following format:
   ```
   N, [(a, b), (c, d), ...]
   ```
   - `N`: Total number of cities (integer).
   - `[(a, b), (c, d), ...]`: List of tuples representing roads between cities, where `a` and `b` are city numbers.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
   ```

3. **Run Traversal**: Click the "Run Traversal" button to start the traversal based on your input.

4. **View Results**: The order of visited cities will be displayed in the results area of the application.

## Error Handling

- If the input format is incorrect, an error message will be displayed.
- Ensure that the roads are defined as tuples of integers and that the input is not empty.

## Example Usage

1. Start the application.
2. Input: `5, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]`
3. Click "Run Traversal".
4. Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (or similar, depending on the connections).

## Conclusion

The City Traversal Application is a simple yet effective tool for visualizing city connections and understanding traversal algorithms. Feel free to modify the code to enhance its functionality or adapt it for different use cases.
