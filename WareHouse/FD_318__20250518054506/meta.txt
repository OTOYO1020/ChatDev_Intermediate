Task:
Define the function 'count_grabbable_treasures(N: int, X: List[int], L: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of treasures, X is a list of treasure coordinates, and L is a list of leg lengths. Implement input handling to read integers N, followed by reading the list of integers X and the list of integers L from standard input. Initialize a variable 'valid_k_count' to count the number of valid integer positions k where the robot can grab all treasures. Iterate through all possible integer positions k from the minimum to the maximum coordinate in X, checking each position for validity. For each position k, simulate the grabbing process using the legs of the robot: for each leg i, check if there are any treasures within the distance L[i] from the current position k. Maintain a set or list to track which treasures have been grabbed to ensure each treasure is only counted once. If all treasures are grabbed for a specific k, increment the 'valid_k_count' by 1. After checking all possible k positions, return the value of 'valid_k_count' as the result of the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when N is at its minimum or maximum limits, and when the coordinates and lengths are at their extreme values. Output the result as an integer representing the number of valid positions k after executing the function.
