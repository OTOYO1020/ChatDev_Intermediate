# Treasure Grabber

A Python application designed to determine the number of valid positions from which a robot can grab all treasures based on their coordinates and the lengths of its legs.

## Quick Install

To run the Treasure Grabber application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Treasure Grabber application allows users to input the number of treasures, their coordinates, and the lengths of the robot's legs. The application then calculates how many valid integer positions exist from which the robot can grab all the treasures.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the number of treasures, their coordinates, and the leg lengths.
2. **Treasure Counting Logic**: The core logic checks all possible positions to determine if all treasures can be grabbed based on the robot's leg lengths.
3. **Output**: The application outputs the number of valid positions from which all treasures can be grabbed.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Treasures**: When prompted, enter the number of treasures (N). Ensure that N is a positive integer.

   ```
   Enter the number of treasures (N): 3
   ```

3. **Input Treasure Coordinates**: Enter the coordinates of the treasures as a comma-separated list.

   ```
   Enter the treasure coordinates (comma-separated, e.g., 1,2,3): 1,3,5
   ```

4. **Input Leg Lengths**: Enter the leg lengths of the robot as a comma-separated list.

   ```
   Enter the leg lengths (comma-separated, e.g., 1,2,3): 1,2,1
   ```

5. **View Results**: The application will output the number of valid positions from which the robot can grab all treasures.

   ```
   Valid Positions: 3
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If N is not a positive integer.
- If the treasure coordinates or leg lengths are empty.
- If the lengths of the coordinates and leg lengths do not match N.
- If any leg lengths are negative.

In case of an error, the application will display an appropriate message.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the application works:

```
Enter the number of treasures (N): 3
Enter the treasure coordinates (comma-separated, e.g., 1,2,3): 1,3,5
Enter the leg lengths (comma-separated, e.g., 1,2,3): 1,2,1
Valid Positions: 3
```

## Conclusion

The Treasure Grabber application is a simple yet effective tool for determining valid positions for treasure grabbing based on user-defined parameters. Feel free to modify the code to enhance its functionality or adapt it to your specific needs.
