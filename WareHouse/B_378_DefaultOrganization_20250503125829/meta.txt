Task:
Read integers N and Q from standard input, where N is the number of garbage types and Q is the number of queries. Initialize two lists: 'q' for the collection periods and 'r' for the collection remainders, each of length N. For each garbage type i (from 1 to N), read the values of 'q[i-1]' and 'r[i-1]' from standard input. For each query j (from 1 to Q), read the values of 't_j' (the type of garbage) and 'd_j' (the day it is put out). Determine the next collection day for the garbage type 't_j' based on the day 'd_j':\n   - Calculate the remainder of 'd_j' modulo 'q[t_j - 1]'.\n   - If the remainder equals 'r[t_j - 1]', the collection day is 'd_j'.\n   - Otherwise, compute the next day when the collection occurs using the formula: 'next_day = d_j + (r[t_j - 1] - (d_j % q[t_j - 1]) + q[t_j - 1]) % q[t_j - 1]'. Store the result of the next collection day for each query. Print the results for all queries, each on a new line.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that all requirements are clearly defined and the necessary computations are outlined for implementation.
