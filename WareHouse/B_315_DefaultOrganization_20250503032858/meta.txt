Task:
Read the integer M from standard input, representing the number of months. Initialize an array 'days' of size M to store the number of days in each month. For each month from 1 to M, read the integer D_i from standard input and store it in 'days[i-1]'. Calculate the total number of days in the year by summing all elements in the 'days' array and store it in 'total_days'. Compute the middle day index as 'middle_day_index = (total_days + 1) // 2'. Initialize variables 'current_day' to 0 and 'month' to 0 to track the current day and month. Loop through each month from 1 to M:\n   - Increment 'current_day' by 'days[month - 1]'.\n   - Check if 'current_day' is greater than or equal to 'middle_day_index':\n     - If true, set 'month' to the current month and break the loop. Calculate the specific day of the month as 'day = middle_day_index - (current_day - days[month - 1])'. Print the results in the format 'month day' where month is 'month' and day is 'day'.
