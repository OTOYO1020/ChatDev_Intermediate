# Graph Connectivity Calculator

A simple application to calculate the expected number of operations needed for a graph with a specified number of vertices to become connected.

## Quick Install

To run the Graph Connectivity Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the application directly without any additional dependencies.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Graph Connectivity Calculator is designed to help users understand the concept of graph connectivity by calculating the expected number of operations required to connect all vertices in a graph. The application reads an integer input representing the number of vertices and computes the expected operations based on the provided algorithm.

### Main Functions

- **calculate_operations(N)**: This function takes an integer `N` (the number of vertices) and returns the expected number of operations needed for the graph to become connected. It handles edge cases such as when `N` is less than or equal to zero.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the application using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input the Number of Vertices**:
   - When prompted, enter a positive integer value for `N` (the number of vertices in the graph).
   - Press `Enter`.

3. **View the Result**:
   - The application will calculate and display the expected number of operations required for the graph to become connected, rounded to six decimal places.

### Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter the number of vertices (N): 5
Expected Operations: 4.700000
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-integer value or a negative integer, the application will prompt you with an error message:
  ```
  Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Graph Connectivity Calculator is a straightforward tool for understanding graph connectivity through expected operations. Feel free to modify the code to explore different scenarios or enhance its functionality!
