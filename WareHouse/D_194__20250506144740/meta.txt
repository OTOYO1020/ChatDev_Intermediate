Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of vertices in the graph. Initialize a variable 'expected_operations' to 0 to keep track of the expected number of operations needed for the graph to become connected. Initialize a variable 'connected_components' to N, representing the number of connected components in the graph initially. While 'connected_components' is greater than 1:\n   - Calculate the probability of choosing a vertex that is not connected to the current component as 'p = (connected_components - 1) / N'.\n   - Update 'expected_operations' using the formula 'expected_operations += 1 / (1 - p)', which accounts for the expected number of trials until a success.\n   - Decrease 'connected_components' by 1, as one more vertex will be connected after the operation. Print the final value of 'expected_operations' rounded to six decimal places.\n\nThis breakdown captures the necessary steps to implement the solution for the problem statement provided.
