Read integers N and M from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'S' to store N strings of length 6. For i from 1 to N, read each string 'S_i' and append it to the list 'S'. Initialize an empty list 'T' to store M strings of length 3. For j from 1 to M, read each string 'T_j' and append it to the list 'T'. Initialize a counter variable 'count' to 0. For each string 'S_i' in the list 'S', extract the last three characters and check if they exist in the list 'T'. If a match is found, increment the 'count' by 1. After processing all strings in 'S', print the value of 'count' as the result. Ensure that the output format is a single integer representing the count of matching strings.
