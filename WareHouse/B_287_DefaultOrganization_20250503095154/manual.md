# String Matcher Application

A simple command-line application to match strings based on user input.

## Overview

The String Matcher application allows users to input a set of strings and check how many of those strings end with specific substrings. The application is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, ensuring that all inputs are validated for length before processing.

## Main Functions

- **Input Collection**: The application prompts the user to enter a specified number of strings of length 6 and a specified number of match strings of length 3.
- **Validation**: Ensures that all input strings meet the required lengths.
- **Matching Logic**: Counts how many of the input strings end with any of the specified match strings.
- **Output**: Displays the count of matching strings.

## Installation

To run the String Matcher application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have external dependencies, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Application Directory**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the application files are located.

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**: The application will prompt you to enter the number of strings (N) and the number of matches (M). Enter the values as requested.

4. **Input Strings**: For each string, you will be prompted to enter a string of exactly 6 characters. If the input is invalid, you will be prompted to try again.

5. **Input Matches**: Similarly, you will be prompted to enter match strings of exactly 3 characters.

6. **View Results**: After all inputs are collected, the application will display the count of matching strings.

## Example Usage

```
Enter number of strings (N): 3
Enter string 1 (must be exactly 6 characters long): hello1
Enter string 2 (must be exactly 6 characters long): world2
Enter string 3 (must be exactly 6 characters long): test34
Collected 3 valid strings for S.
Enter number of matches (M): 2
Enter match 1 (must be exactly 3 characters long): 2
Enter match 2 (must be exactly 3 characters long): 34
Collected 2 valid matches for T.
1
```

In this example, the application counted 1 match where the last three characters of one of the strings matched one of the provided match strings.
