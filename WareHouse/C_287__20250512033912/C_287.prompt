Define the function 'is_path_graph(N: int, M: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool' to determine if the given graph is a path graph. Parse the input to extract the number of vertices 'N' and the number of edges 'M'. Store the edges in a list of tuples 'edges' where each tuple contains the vertices 'u_i' and 'v_i' for each edge. Check if the number of edges 'M' is equal to 'N - 1', as a path graph must have exactly 'N - 1' edges. Create a set or adjacency list to represent the graph for easy traversal and checking of connections. Iterate through the edges to populate the graph representation and ensure there are no self-loops or multiple edges. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to check if all vertices are connected. Verify that the vertices can be visited in a sequence that satisfies the path graph conditions: consecutive vertices must be connected, and non-consecutive vertices must not be connected. Return 'True' if the graph meets the path graph conditions, otherwise return 'False'. Output the result of the function in the format 'print(result)' where 'result' is the boolean output of 'is_path_graph'.
