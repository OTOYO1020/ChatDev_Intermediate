# Graph Path Checker

A tool to determine if a given graph is a path graph based on its vertices and edges.

## Quick Install

To install the necessary dependencies for the Graph Path Checker, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Graph Path Checker is a Python application designed to check if a given graph is a path graph. A path graph is defined as a graph that consists of a sequence of vertices where each vertex is connected to exactly two other vertices, except for the endpoints which are connected to only one vertex.

### Main Functions

- **is_path_graph(N: int, M: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool**: This function checks if the provided graph is a path graph by:
  - Validating the number of edges against the number of vertices.
  - Ensuring there are no self-loops or multiple edges.
  - Performing a depth-first search (DFS) to check for connectivity.
  - Verifying that the graph meets the path graph conditions.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your Python environment.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - **Number of Vertices (N)**: Enter the total number of vertices in the graph.
   - **Number of Edges (M)**: Enter the total number of edges in the graph.
   - **Edges Input**: Enter the edges in the format `(u v)` separated by commas. For example, for edges between vertex 1 and 2, and vertex 2 and 3, you would input `1 2, 2 3`.

3. **Output**: The application will output whether the provided graph is a path graph or not.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of vertices (N): 4
Enter the number of edges (M): 3
Enter edges (u v) separated by commas: 1 2, 2 3, 3 4
Is path graph: True
```

## Error Handling

- If the number of edges provided does not match the specified M, an error message will be displayed.
- If any vertex is out of the valid range (1 to N), or if there are self-loops or multiple edges, appropriate error messages will be shown.

## Conclusion

The Graph Path Checker is a straightforward tool for validating path graphs. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can easily determine the structure of your graph.
