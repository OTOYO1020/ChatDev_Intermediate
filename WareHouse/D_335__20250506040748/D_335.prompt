Read the integer N from standard input, ensuring that it is an odd number within the range of 3 to 45. Initialize a 2D grid of size N x N to represent the placement of Takahashi and the dragon parts. Place Takahashi at the center of the grid, specifically at cell \((\frac{N+1}{2}, \frac{N+1}{2})\). Initialize a variable 'current_part' to 1, which will be used to track the current dragon part to place. Create a list of directions representing the possible adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). Set the starting position for placing the dragon parts to the cell adjacent to Takahashi. Use a loop to place each dragon part from 1 to \(N^2-1\) in the grid:\n   - For each part, check the adjacent cells for valid placements (i.e., cells that are within bounds and not already occupied).\n   - Place the current part in a valid adjacent cell and update the position for the next part. Ensure that the placement of each part adheres to the adjacency condition specified in the problem statement. After all parts are placed, prepare the grid for output. Print the grid, showing the arrangement of Takahashi and the dragon parts.
