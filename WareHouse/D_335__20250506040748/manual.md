# Takahashi and Dragon Parts Placement

A fun and interactive application that allows users to place Takahashi and dragon parts on a grid based on user input.

## Introduction

This software enables users to create a grid of size \(N \times N\) (where \(N\) is an odd number between 3 and 45) and strategically place Takahashi at the center of the grid. The application then fills the grid with dragon parts, ensuring that each part is placed adjacent to the previous one. The final arrangement is printed in a visually appealing format.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Prompts the user to enter an odd integer between 3 and 45.
- **Grid Initialization**: Creates a 2D grid of size \(N \times N\) and places Takahashi at the center.
- **Part Placement**: Systematically places dragon parts in valid adjacent cells.
- **Output Display**: Prints the final grid arrangement to the console.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, so you can run it directly with Python.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the application files are located, and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input an Odd Number**: When prompted, enter an odd integer between 3 and 45. For example:
   ```
   Enter an odd number between 3 and 45: 7
   ```

3. **View the Output**: After entering a valid number, the application will generate the grid and display it in the console. The grid will show 'T' for Takahashi and numbers for the dragon parts. For example:
   ```
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6
   0  0  0  0  0  0  0
   0  0  T  0  0  0  0
   0  0  1  2  3  4  5
   0  0  0  0  0  0  0
   0  0  0  0  0  0  0
   0  0  0  0  0  0  0
   ```

4. **Repeat**: You can run the application multiple times to create different grid arrangements by entering different odd numbers.

## Conclusion

This application provides an engaging way to visualize grid placements and can be a fun exercise in programming logic and grid management. Enjoy placing Takahashi and the dragon parts!
