# Shortest Path Graph Solver

This software is designed to find the shortest path in a graph using a three-layer structure and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. It efficiently handles large graphs with up to 100,000 vertices and edges.

## Main Functions

- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as a three-layer structure where each vertex is expanded into three states based on modulo 3.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: The software implements BFS to find the shortest path from a starting vertex to a target vertex.
- **Input/Output**: The program reads input from standard input and outputs the result to standard output.

## Installation

This project does not rely on any third-party libraries. To set up the environment, ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher). You can clone the repository and run the code directly.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Install Dependencies

Since there are no external dependencies, you can directly run the code without any additional installations.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: The input should be provided in the following format:
   - The first line contains the number of vertices `N`.
   - The second line contains the number of edges `M`.
   - The next `M` lines each contain a pair of vertices `u` and `v` representing an edge.
   - The last two lines contain the starting vertex `S` and the target vertex `T`.

   Example input:
   ```
   5
   6
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   4 5
   1 3
   2 5
   1
   5
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```
   Here, `input.txt` is a file containing the input in the specified format.

3. **Output**: The program will output the shortest distance divided by three if a path exists. If no valid path exists, it will output `-1`.

## Example Usage

Given the input:
```
5
6
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
2 5
1
5
```

Running the command:
```bash
python main.py < input.txt
```

Will output:
```
2
```

This indicates that the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 5 requires 2 moves in the transformed graph structure.

## Performance

The implementation is optimized to run in O(N + M) time complexity, making it efficient for large graphs with constraints up to 100,000 vertices and edges.

## Conclusion

This software provides a robust solution for finding the shortest path in a graph using a unique three-layer structure. It is designed for ease of use and efficiency, making it suitable for various applications in graph theory and network analysis.
