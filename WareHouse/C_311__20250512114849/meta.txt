Task:
Define the function find_directed_cycle(N: int, A: List[int]) to accept the number of vertices N and the list of edges A. Initialize a list to keep track of visited vertices to avoid revisiting them during the cycle search. Iterate through each vertex from 1 to N to start searching for a cycle. For each vertex, follow the directed edges according to the list A until a cycle is detected or all reachable vertices are visited. Use a set to keep track of the current path of vertices to identify when a cycle is formed. Check if the current vertex being visited is already in the current path set to confirm a cycle. Once a cycle is detected, construct the cycle path from the current path set. Ensure that the cycle path meets the conditions of having at least 2 vertices and no repeated vertices. Return the cycle path as a list of vertices that form the directed cycle. Output the result in the format specified, ensuring it adheres to the problem's output requirements.
