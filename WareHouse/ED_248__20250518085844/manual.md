# Line Counter

A Python application for counting unique lines formed by a set of points in a 2D space.

## Overview

The Line Counter application allows users to input a set of points and a minimum number of points (K) that a line must pass through. The application then calculates the number of unique lines that can be formed by K or more collinear points. It also handles edge cases, such as when all points are collinear, returning "Infinity".

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Accepts a list of points and a minimum threshold (K).
- **Collinearity Check**: Determines if K or more points are collinear using the cross product method.
- **Unique Line Counting**: Counts the number of unique lines formed by combinations of points that meet the collinearity criteria.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid inputs, such as K being greater than the number of points.

## Installation

To run the Line Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Points**: When prompted, enter the points in the format `x1,y1 x2,y2 ...` (e.g., `1,2 2,3 3,4`).

3. **Input Minimum Points (K)**: Enter the minimum number of points (K) that a line must pass through.

4. **View Results**: The application will output the result, which can be either the count of unique lines or "Infinity" if all points are collinear.

### Example Input

```
Enter points (x1,y1 x2,y2 ...): 1,2 2,3 3,4 4,5
Enter minimum points (K): 2
```

### Example Output

```
Result: 1
```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling. If you enter an invalid input, such as K being greater than the number of points, you will receive an error message. 

### Example Error

```
Input Error: K cannot be greater than the number of points.
```

## Testing the Functionality

You can test the application with various test cases, including edge cases with minimum and maximum values. Ensure to cover scenarios such as:

- All points being collinear.
- No points or less than two points.
- Duplicate points in the input.

## Conclusion

The Line Counter application is a powerful tool for analyzing sets of points in a 2D space. By following the instructions above, you can easily install, run, and utilize the application for your needs.
