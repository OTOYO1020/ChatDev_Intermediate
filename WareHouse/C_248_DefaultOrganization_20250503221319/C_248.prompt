Read integers N, M, and K from standard input. Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to store the number of valid sequences. Create a function 'count_sequences(N, M, K)' that will calculate the number of valid integer sequences. In 'count_sequences', use a recursive approach or dynamic programming to generate all possible sequences of length N where each element is between 1 and M. For each generated sequence, check if the sum of the sequence is less than or equal to K. If the condition is satisfied, increment the 'count' variable. After generating all sequences, compute the result as 'count % 998244353'. Return the computed result from 'count_sequences'. Print the result as the final output.
