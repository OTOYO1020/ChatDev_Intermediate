# Sequence Counter

A Python application for counting valid integer sequences based on user-defined parameters.

## Introduction

The Sequence Counter application allows users to generate and count valid integer sequences of a specified length (N) where each element is constrained between 1 and a maximum value (M). The application checks if the sum of the sequence is less than or equal to a specified maximum sum (K). The result is returned modulo 998244353.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user inputs for N, M, and K are valid integers.
- **Count Sequences**: Calculates the number of valid integer sequences using dynamic programming.
- **Output**: Displays the count of valid sequences that meet the criteria.

## Installation

To run the Sequence Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. If you have the files directly, ensure they are in the same directory.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the application files.

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Input Parameters**: The application will prompt you to enter three integers:
   - **N**: Length of the sequences (must be a positive integer).
   - **M**: Maximum value in sequences (must be a positive integer).
   - **K**: Maximum sum of sequences (must be a non-negative integer).

5. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will compute and display the count of valid sequences.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter N (length of sequences, must be a positive integer): 3
Enter M (maximum value in sequences, must be a positive integer): 5
Enter K (maximum sum of sequences, must be a non-negative integer): 10
Valid sequences count: 35
```

## Error Handling

- If the input values are invalid (e.g., non-integer values, negative integers), the application will display an error message and prompt for valid inputs.
- If K is less than N, the application will inform the user that no valid sequences can exist.

## Conclusion

The Sequence Counter application provides a straightforward way to calculate valid integer sequences based on user-defined parameters. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
