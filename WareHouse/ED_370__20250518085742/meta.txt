Task:
Define the function 'count_valid_divisions(N: int, K: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the length of the sequence, 'K' is the target sum, and 'A' is the list of integers representing the sequence. Implement input handling to read 'N', 'K', and the sequence 'A' from standard input. Calculate the total number of ways to divide the sequence 'A' into contiguous subsequences, which is '2^(N-1)'. Iterate through all possible divisions of 'A' using a bitmask approach to represent the positions of subsequences. For each division, compute the sum of each subsequence and check if any subsequence sums to 'K'. Maintain a count of valid divisions that do not contain any subsequence summing to 'K'. Ensure that the count of valid divisions is computed modulo '998244353' to handle large numbers. Return the final count of valid divisions from the function 'count_valid_divisions'. Test the function with various edge cases, including minimum and maximum values for 'N', 'K', and elements of 'A'. Output the result of the function in the required format after processing the input.
