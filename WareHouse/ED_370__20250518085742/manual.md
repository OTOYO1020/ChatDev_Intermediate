# Valid Divisions Calculator

A Python application for calculating the number of valid divisions of a sequence into contiguous subsequences, ensuring that no subsequence sums to a specified target value.

## Main Functions

The application consists of two main components:

1. **Input Handling**: The application reads input values for the length of the sequence (N), the target sum (K), and the sequence of integers (A) from the user.
2. **Calculation of Valid Divisions**: The core function, `count_valid_divisions`, computes the number of ways to divide the sequence into contiguous subsequences such that no subsequence sums to K. The result is returned modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers.

## Installation

To run the Valid Divisions Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application requires the following Python libraries:
- `typing` (standard library, no installation needed)

### Quick Install

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` and `calculator.py` files.
3. Ensure you have Python installed and run the application using the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. Execute the `main.py` script in your terminal or command prompt.
2. You will be prompted to enter the following inputs:
   - **N**: Length of the sequence (must be a non-negative integer).
   - **K**: Target sum (an integer).
   - **A**: A list of integers representing the sequence (space-separated).

### Example Input

```
Enter N (length of sequence): 4
Enter K (target sum): 5
Enter A (space-separated integers): 1 2 3 4
```

### Example Output

```
Valid divisions count: 6
```

### Edge Cases

- If `N` is 0, the output will be `0` since there are no elements to divide.
- If `N` is 1, the output will be `1` if the single element does not equal `K`, otherwise `0`.
- The application handles large sequences efficiently using a bitmask approach.

## Testing

You can test the function with various edge cases, including:
- Minimum values for `N` and `K`.
- Maximum values for `N` (up to reasonable limits based on performance).
- Different combinations of elements in `A` to ensure comprehensive coverage of possible scenarios.

## Conclusion

The Valid Divisions Calculator is a powerful tool for analyzing sequences and their subdivisions. By following the instructions above, you can easily set up and use the application to explore various configurations of sequences and their valid divisions.
