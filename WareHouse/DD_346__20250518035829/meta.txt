Task:
Define the function 'min_cost_to_good_string(S: str, C: List[int]) -> int' that takes a string S and a list of costs C as input. Validate the input string S to ensure it consists only of '0' and '1' and has a length N such that 2 <= N <= 200000. Validate the input list C to ensure it has the same length as S and each cost C[i] is within the range 1 <= C[i] <= 10^9. Iterate through the string S to determine the positions where characters can be flipped to create a good string. For each possible position i (1 <= i <= N-1), calculate the cost of flipping characters to ensure T[i] and T[i+1] are the same. Keep track of the minimum cost encountered while evaluating all possible positions for creating a good string. Implement logic to handle cases where no flips are needed, ensuring the cost remains valid. Return the minimum total cost calculated from the previous steps. Ensure that the function handles edge cases such as strings already being good or requiring maximum flips. Output the result as an integer representing the minimum cost to convert S into a good string.
