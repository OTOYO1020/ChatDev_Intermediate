# Good String Calculator

A utility to calculate the minimum cost to convert a binary string into a "good" string, where a good string consists of consecutive identical characters.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this software is `min_cost_to_good_string(S: str, C: List[int]) -> int`, which takes a binary string `S` and a list of costs `C` as input. The function performs the following:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures that the string consists only of '0' and '1', has a length between 2 and 200,000, and that the cost list has the same length as the string with valid cost values.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Iterates through the string to determine the minimum cost required to convert it into a good string by flipping characters.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Returns 0 if the string is already a good string, and calculates costs efficiently for strings requiring flips.

## Installation

To run the Good String Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

   Note: The `typing` module is included in Python 3.5 and later, so you may not need to install it separately.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: After setting up the environment, you can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. Use the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Data**: When prompted, enter a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's. For example:

   ```
   Enter binary string (0s and 1s): 010101
   ```

   Then, enter the costs associated with each character in the string, separated by commas. For example:

   ```
   Enter costs (comma-separated): 1,2,3,4,5,6
   ```

3. **View the Result**: The application will process the input and display the minimum cost required to convert the string into a good string. For example:

   ```
   Minimum Cost: 6
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the Good String Calculator:

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the binary string:

   ```
   Enter binary string (0s and 1s): 110011
   ```

3. Input the costs:

   ```
   Enter costs (comma-separated): 5,1,2,3,4,6
   ```

4. The output will show the minimum cost:

   ```
   Minimum Cost: 3
   ```

## Conclusion

The Good String Calculator is a powerful tool for determining the minimum cost to convert binary strings into good strings. With its efficient algorithms and input validation, it ensures accurate results while handling various edge cases.
