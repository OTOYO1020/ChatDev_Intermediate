# Cycle Detection Software

Detect cycles in directed graphs efficiently using our cycle detection software.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a directed graph and detect cycles within it. The main functions include reading the number of vertices, populating the graph with edges, and identifying any cycles present. The software is designed to operate within O(N) time complexity, ensuring efficiency even for larger graphs.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Read the number of vertices and edges from standard input.
- **Cycle Detection**: Identify cycles in the directed graph and ensure they meet specific criteria (length of at least 2, valid edges).
- **Output**: Display the detected cycles or indicate if no cycles are found.

## Installation

To run the cycle detection software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the software files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cycle-detection.git
   cd cycle-detection
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This software does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## Usage

To use the cycle detection software, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main Python script.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Vertices**: When prompted, enter the number of vertices in the directed graph.
   ```
   Enter the number of vertices: N
   ```

3. **Input the Edges**: Provide the edges in the format specified (one integer per vertex). Each integer should represent the vertex that the corresponding vertex points to.
   ```
   Enter the edges (one integer per vertex, format: A[i] for vertex i):
   ```

4. **View the Output**: The software will process the input and display any detected cycles or indicate that no cycles were found.
   ```
   Cycles found:
   [cycle vertices]
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the software:

1. Input the number of vertices:
   ```
   Enter the number of vertices: 5
   ```

2. Input the edges:
   ```
   Enter the edges (one integer per vertex, format: A[i] for vertex i):
   2 3 4 5 2
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   Cycles found:
   [2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

## Edge Cases

- **Self-loops**: The software will raise an error if a self-loop is detected.
- **Invalid Input**: Ensure that the number of edges matches the number of vertices. The software will raise an error if this condition is not met.
