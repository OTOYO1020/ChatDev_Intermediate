Task:
Read integers N (number of stones) and K (number of possible moves) from standard input. Read the sequence of integers A (A_1, A_2, ..., A_K) representing the possible moves. Initialize variables 'takahashi_stones = 0' and 'aoki_stones = 0' to keep track of the stones removed by each player. Set 'current_stones = N' to represent the current number of stones in the pile. Implement a loop that continues until 'current_stones' is greater than 0:\n   - In each iteration, Takahashi chooses the maximum possible value from A that is less than or equal to 'current_stones' and removes it from the pile.\n   - Update 'takahashi_stones' by adding the number of stones removed.\n   - Check if 'current_stones' is still greater than 0; if so, Aoki then chooses the maximum possible value from A that is less than or equal to 'current_stones' and removes it from the pile.\n   - Update 'aoki_stones' by adding the number of stones removed. After the loop ends, return the total number of stones removed by Takahashi. Print the value of 'takahashi_stones' as the final output.
