# Sequence Manager

A simple application for managing a sequence of integers through standard input and output.

## Overview

The Sequence Manager allows users to read a sequence of integers, update specific values, and print values based on user-defined queries. This application is designed to handle a series of operations efficiently, making it suitable for scenarios where quick updates and retrievals of data are necessary.

## Main Functions

1. **Set Sequence**: Initialize the sequence with a list of integers.
2. **Update Value**: Modify a specific value in the sequence based on user input.
3. **Print Value**: Retrieve and display a value from the sequence.

## Installation

To run the Sequence Manager, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not already provided) and install any necessary dependencies. For this application, there are no external dependencies, but you can create the file as follows:
   ```plaintext
   # requirements.txt
   # No additional dependencies required
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: You can run the application directly using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Input the Sequence**:
   - First, enter the integer `N`, which represents the length of the sequence.
   - Next, input the sequence of integers separated by spaces.

   Example:
   ```
   5
   10 20 30 40 50
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Queries**:
   - Enter the integer `Q`, which indicates how many queries you will perform.

   Example:
   ```
   3
   ```

3. **Perform Queries**:
   - For each query, input the type of query followed by the necessary parameters:
     - **Type 1**: Update a value in the sequence.
       - Format: `1 k x` (where `k` is the index to update and `x` is the new value)
       - Example: `1 3 35` (This updates the 3rd element to 35)
     - **Type 2**: Print a value from the sequence.
       - Format: `2 k` (where `k` is the index to print)
       - Example: `2 3` (This prints the 3rd element)

4. **Output**:
   - The application will print the results of all type '2' queries in the order they were received.

## Example Session

```
Input:
5
10 20 30 40 50
3
1 3 35
2 3
2 1

Output:
35
10
```

## Error Handling

- The application includes error handling for invalid inputs, such as:
  - Non-integer values for `N` or `Q`.
  - Sequence length mismatch.
  - Out-of-bounds index access during updates or prints.

## Conclusion

The Sequence Manager is a straightforward tool for managing integer sequences with efficient update and retrieval functionalities. It is designed to be user-friendly and robust against common input errors.
