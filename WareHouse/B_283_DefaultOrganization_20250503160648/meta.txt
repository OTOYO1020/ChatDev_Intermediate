Task:
Read the integer N and the sequence A of length N from standard input. Initialize a list 'A' to store the values of the sequence. Read the integer Q representing the number of queries. Loop through Q queries:\n   - For each query, read the type (1 or 2) and the corresponding parameters (k, and x if applicable).\n   - If the query type is '1', call the function 'update_value(k, x)' to set 'A[k-1]' to 'x'.\n   - If the query type is '2', call the function 'print_value(k)' to print the value of 'A[k-1]'. Implement the 'update_value(k, x)' function to update the value at index 'k-1' in the list A. Implement the 'print_value(k)' function to output the value at index 'k-1' in the list A. Ensure that all index accesses are within bounds (1 ≤ k ≤ N). Handle input and output efficiently to accommodate the upper limits of N and Q. Print the results for all type '2' queries in the order they were received. Ensure that the program runs within the time limits given the constraints.
