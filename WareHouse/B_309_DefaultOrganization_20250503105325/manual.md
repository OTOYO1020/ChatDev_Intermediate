# Grid Manipulation Application

A Python application for manipulating a grid of binary values (0s and 1s) by shifting the outer squares in a clockwise direction.

## Main Functions

The application provides the following main functionalities:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads an integer N to define the dimensions of an N x N grid and populates the grid with binary values (0 or 1).
2. **Outer Squares Extraction**: Collects the values from the outer layer of the grid in a clockwise order.
3. **Clockwise Shift**: Shifts the collected outer square values by one position in a clockwise direction.
4. **Grid Update**: Updates the original grid with the shifted values and prints the modified grid.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Grid Size**: When prompted, enter the size of the grid (N). This should be a non-negative integer.

4. **Input the Grid Values**: Enter each row of the grid as space-separated integers (0 or 1). Ensure that each row contains exactly N integers.

   Example Input:
   ```
   3
   1 0 1
   0 1 0
   1 0 1
   ```

5. **View the Modified Grid**: After processing, the application will print the modified grid with the outer squares shifted clockwise.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Modified Grid:
   1 1 0
   1 1 1
   0 1 1
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the application works:

1. Start the application.
2. Input the size of the grid:
   ```
   Enter the size of the grid (N): 3
   ```
3. Input the grid values:
   ```
   Enter each row of the grid as space-separated integers (0 or 1):
   1 0 1
   0 1 0
   1 0 1
   ```
4. The application processes the input and outputs the modified grid:
   ```
   Modified Grid:
   1 1 0
   1 1 1
   0 1 1
   ```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a negative integer for N, the application will raise a `ValueError`.
- If any row does not contain exactly N integers or contains values other than 0 or 1, the application will raise a `ValueError`.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to manipulate a binary grid by shifting its outer squares. It is designed for ease of use and can be run in any standard Python environment.
