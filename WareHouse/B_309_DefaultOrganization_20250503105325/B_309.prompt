Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the dimensions of the grid (N x N). Initialize a 2D list 'grid' to store the values of the grid. Populate the 'grid' by reading N lines of input, each containing N integers (either 0 or 1). Create a list 'outer_squares' to store the values of the outer squares in clockwise order. Shift the values in 'outer_squares' by one position clockwise. Update the 'grid' with the new values from 'outer_squares' back into their respective positions. Print the modified 'grid' in the required format.\n\n### Function and Variable Names\n- Function: No specific function is defined, but the operations can be encapsulated in a function if needed.\n- Variables: 'N', 'grid', 'outer_squares'.\n\n### Input Format\n- The input consists of an integer N followed by N lines of N integers each. This will be handled in step 1 and step 3.\n\n### Output Format\n- The output will be the modified grid printed line by line, as described in step 7.
