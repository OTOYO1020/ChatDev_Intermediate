# Coprime Finder

A utility for finding coprime integers within a specified range.

## Overview

The Coprime Finder is designed to identify all integers `k` from `1` to `M` that are coprime with all integers in a given list `A`. This software is useful for mathematical computations and number theory applications.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The software reads the number of integers `N`, the upper limit `M`, and the list of integers `A` from standard input.
- **Coprime Calculation**: It checks each integer `k` from `1` to `M` to determine if it is coprime with all integers in `A` using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
- **Output**: The software outputs a space-separated string of all coprime integers found.

## Installation

To run the Coprime Finder, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: The `requirements.txt` file should include any additional libraries if needed. For this project, the standard library suffices.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of integers `N` (must be a non-negative integer).
   - Enter the upper limit `M` (must be a positive integer).
   - Enter the integers for list `A` as space-separated values. Ensure the number of integers matches `N` and all integers are positive.

3. **View Results**: After entering the inputs, the application will process the data and output the coprime integers found. If no coprime integers are found, it will notify you accordingly.

## Example Usage

```
Enter number of integers (N): 3
Enter upper limit (M): 10
Enter integers (space-separated): 6 10 15
Coprime integers: 1 7
```

## Edge Cases

- If `N` is `0`, the application will notify you that there are no integers to check for coprimality.
- If `M` is less than `1`, the application will raise an error indicating that `M` must be a positive integer.
- If the provided list `A` does not match the specified size `N`, an error will be raised.

## Conclusion

The Coprime Finder is a straightforward tool for identifying coprime integers, making it a valuable resource for mathematicians and developers alike. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the support team.
