Task:
Define the function 'find_coprime_integers(N: int, M: int, A: List[int]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the number of integers, 'M' is the upper limit for 'k', and 'A' is the list of positive integers. Implement input handling to read integers 'N' and 'M', and the list 'A' of size 'N' from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'result' to store all integers 'k' that satisfy the condition. Iterate through each integer 'k' from '1' to 'M' (inclusive). For each 'k', check if 'gcd(A[i], k) == 1' for all integers 'i' in the range '1' to 'N'. If 'gcd(A[i], k) == 1' holds true for all 'i', append 'k' to the 'result' list. Optimize the GCD check using properties of coprimality to reduce unnecessary calculations. Return the 'result' list containing all valid integers 'k' that meet the condition. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when 'N' or 'M' is at its minimum or maximum limits. Output the result as a space-separated string of integers from the 'result' list.
