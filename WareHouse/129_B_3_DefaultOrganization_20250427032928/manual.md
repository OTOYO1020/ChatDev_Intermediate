# Weight Difference Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum absolute difference between two partitions of weights.

## Overview

The Weight Difference Calculator allows users to input a list of weights and computes the minimum absolute difference between the sums of two groups formed by dividing the weights at various points. This application is particularly useful in scenarios where balancing weights is essential.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Accepts an integer `N` representing the number of weights and an array `W` containing the weights.
- **Minimum Difference Calculation**: Computes the minimum absolute difference between the sums of two partitions of the weights.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid inputs, such as non-integer weights or mismatched weight counts.

## Installation

To run the Weight Difference Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Weights**: When prompted, enter the number of weights (N) followed by the weights themselves, separated by spaces. For example:

   ```
   Enter the number of weights (N): 5
   Enter the weights separated by spaces (indexed from 1 to N): 10 20 30 40 50
   ```

4. **View Results**: The application will output the minimum absolute difference between the two partitions of weights.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of weights (N): 5
Enter the weights separated by spaces (indexed from 1 to N): 10 20 30 40 50
Minimum absolute difference: 10
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the number of weights entered is less than 2, an error message will be displayed.
- If any of the weights are not integers, an error message will be displayed.
- If the number of weights does not match the specified count, an error message will be displayed.
- If any weight is negative, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Weight Difference Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating the minimum absolute difference between two partitions of weights. By following the instructions above, users can easily install and utilize the application for their needs.
