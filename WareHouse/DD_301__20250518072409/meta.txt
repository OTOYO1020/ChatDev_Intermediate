Task:
Define a function 'greatest_value_less_than_or_equal(N: int, S: str) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for finding the greatest value. Parse the input to extract the integer 'N' and the string 'S'. Generate all possible binary strings by replacing each '?' in 'S' with '0' or '1'. Convert each generated binary string into its decimal integer representation. Store all unique decimal values in a set 'T'. Filter the set 'T' to retain only values that are less than or equal to 'N'. Determine the maximum value from the filtered set. If the set is empty, prepare to return '-1'. Return the maximum value found or '-1' if no valid values exist. Implement error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring 'N' is within the specified range and 'S' contains only valid characters. Format the output as specified, ensuring it is a single integer value.
