# Greatest Value Finder

A Python application for calculating the greatest binary value less than or equal to a specified integer based on a binary string with placeholders.

## Main Functions

The primary function of this software is to define the function `greatest_value_less_than_or_equal(N: int, S: str) -> int`. This function performs the following tasks:

1. **Input Parsing**: Accepts an integer `N` and a binary string `S` that may contain '?' characters.
2. **Binary String Generation**: Generates all possible binary strings by replacing '?' in `S` with '0' or '1'.
3. **Decimal Conversion**: Converts each generated binary string into its decimal integer representation.
4. **Value Filtering**: Filters the unique decimal values to retain only those that are less than or equal to `N`.
5. **Maximum Value Calculation**: Determines the maximum value from the filtered set and returns it. If no valid values exist, it returns `-1`.
6. **Error Handling**: Implements error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring `N` is within the specified range and `S` contains only valid characters.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher). Then, install any required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Input Prompt**: When you run the application, you will be prompted to enter an integer `N` and a binary string `S`.
   - **N**: Enter an integer value between `0` and `1,000,000`.
   - **S**: Enter a binary string that may include '0', '1', and '?' characters.

2. **Example Inputs**:
   - For `N`, you might enter `10`.
   - For `S`, you might enter `1?0?`.

3. **Output**: The application will calculate and display the result:
   - If valid binary values exist that are less than or equal to `N`, it will display the maximum value.
   - If no valid values exist, it will display `-1`.

4. **Error Handling**: If you enter invalid inputs, the application will provide an error message indicating the nature of the input error.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter N (integer): 10
Enter S (binary string with '?'): 1?0?
Result: 10
```
