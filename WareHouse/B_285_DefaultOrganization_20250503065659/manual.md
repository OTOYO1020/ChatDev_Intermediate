# String Comparison Program

This program reads an integer N and a string S from standard input, then calculates and displays the maximum values of l for each i based on specific character comparisons in the string.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer N and a string S. It validates the input to ensure N is within the appropriate range.
- **Character Comparison**: For each integer i from 1 to N-1, the program compares characters in the string S at positions l and l + i, counting how many characters are not equal until it finds a match or reaches the end of the string.
- **Results Display**: The program outputs the results, showing the maximum values of l for each i on separate lines.

## Installation Instructions

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**: Although this program does not require any external libraries, you can create a `requirements.txt` file for future expansions. For now, you can skip this step.

## How to Use the Program

1. **Run the Program**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Execute the program using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter a positive integer N (ensure it is less than or equal to the length of the string you will provide).
   - Next, enter the string S.

3. **View Results**:
   - The program will display the maximum values of l for each i from 1 to N-1, each on a new line.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter a positive integer N (less than or equal to the length of the string): 5
Enter a string S: hello
0
1
2
3
```

In this example, the program compares characters in the string "hello" and outputs the maximum values of l for each i.

## Notes

- Ensure that the input string S is long enough to accommodate the integer N.
- The program is designed to handle invalid inputs gracefully, prompting the user to try again if necessary.

## Future Enhancements

This program can be expanded in the future to include additional features such as:
- Enhanced input validation.
- Support for different types of string comparisons.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.

For any issues or feature requests, please contact the support team.
