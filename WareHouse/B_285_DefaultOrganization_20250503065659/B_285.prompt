Read the integer N and the string S from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'results' to store the maximum values of l for each i. Loop through each integer i from 1 to N-1:\n   - Initialize 'l' to 0.\n   - While 'l + i <= N':\n     - Check if the characters S[l] and S[l + i] are not equal.\n     - If they are not equal, increment l by 1.\n     - If they are equal, break the loop.\n   - Append the final value of l to the 'results' list. Print the values in the 'results' list, each on a new line.
