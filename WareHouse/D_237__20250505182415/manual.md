# List Manipulation Application

This application allows users to manipulate a list based on a series of commands represented by a string of 'L' and 'R'. The application reads an integer N and a string S, then modifies a list according to the specified commands.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer N and a string S from standard input.
- **List Initialization**: Initializes a list A with a single element [0].
- **Command Processing**: Loops through each character in the string S:
  - If the character is 'L', it inserts the index before the last element of the list.
  - If the character is 'R', it appends the index to the end of the list.
- **Output**: After processing all commands, it prints the final contents of the list A as a space-separated string.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python installed correctly.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Run the application using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Requirements**:
   - When prompted, enter an integer N (the length of the string S).
   - Enter a string S composed only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The length of S must match the integer N.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - If you enter `5` for N and `LRRLL`, the application will process these commands and output the final list.
   - The expected output for this input would be: `3 4 5 0`.

4. **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling. If the input does not meet the requirements (e.g., length mismatch or invalid characters), an error message will be displayed.

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: The main application file that handles input and processes the commands.
- **input_handler.py**: A module that contains functions for inserting and appending elements to the list.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to manipulate lists based on user-defined commands. It is designed to be user-friendly and robust, with error handling to guide users in case of incorrect input.
