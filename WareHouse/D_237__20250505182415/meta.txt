Task:
Read the integer N and the string S from standard input. Initialize a list A with a single element [0]. Loop through each character in the string S using its index:\n   - For each index i (from 1 to N):\n     - If S[i-1] is 'L', insert i to the left of the last element in A.\n     - If S[i-1] is 'R', append i to the right of the last element in A. Use the 'insert_left(A, i)' function to handle the insertion for 'L'. Use the 'append_right(A, i)' function to handle the insertion for 'R'. After processing all characters in S, prepare the final contents of A. Print the final contents of A as a space-separated string.
