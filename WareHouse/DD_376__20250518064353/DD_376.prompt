Define a function 'find_cycle(N: int, M: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int]])' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the number of vertices, 'M' is the number of edges, and 'edges' is a list of tuples representing directed edges. Parse the input to extract the values of 'N', 'M', and the list of edges. Ensure that the input adheres to the constraints provided. Implement a graph representation using an adjacency list to store the directed edges for efficient traversal. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or another suitable algorithm to detect cycles in the graph, specifically focusing on cycles that include vertex '1'. Maintain a record of the visited vertices and the recursion stack to help identify cycles during the DFS traversal. If a cycle is detected that includes vertex '1', calculate the number of edges in that cycle. Keep track of the minimum number of edges among all cycles that contain vertex '1' during the cycle detection process. If no cycle is found that includes vertex '1', prepare to return a specific output indicating the absence of such cycles. Return the minimum number of edges in a cycle containing vertex '1' if found, or an appropriate message if no such cycle exists. Ensure the output format is consistent with the problem statement, returning either an integer or a specific message based on the findings.
