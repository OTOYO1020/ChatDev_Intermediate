# Score Calculator

A simple application to calculate the maximum score based on a given permutation of movements across a set of scores.

## Quick Install

To run the Score Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# Add any required dependencies here
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Score Calculator application allows users to determine the maximum score achievable by moving through a series of squares based on a permutation array. Each square has a score, and the movement is dictated by the permutation array.

### Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads integers N (number of squares) and K (maximum moves) from standard input, along with the scores for each square and the permutation array.
- **Score Calculation**: The application calculates the maximum score by simulating movements through the squares, taking care to avoid cycles.
- **Output**: The maximum score is printed as the final output.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain two integers, N and K.
   - The second line should contain N space-separated integers representing the scores for each square.
   - The third line should contain N space-separated integers representing the permutation array.

   Example input:
   ```
   5 3
   10 20 30 40 50
   2 3 4 5 1
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application from the command line. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Provide Input**: After running the command, provide the input as described above. You can either type it directly or redirect from a file.

4. **View Output**: The application will output the maximum score based on the provided input.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Score Calculator:

1. Create an input file named `input.txt` with the following content:

   ```
   5 3
   10 20 30 40 50
   2 3 4 5 1
   ```

2. Run the application and redirect the input from the file:

   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

3. The output will display the maximum score based on the input provided.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the lengths of the scores and permutation arrays do not match N, a `ValueError` will be raised.
- If the permutation values are not unique or are out of the expected range (1 to N), a `ValueError` will be raised.
- If an attempt is made to access an index out of bounds in the score array, an `IndexError` will be raised.

## Conclusion

The Score Calculator is a straightforward application designed to help users calculate the maximum score based on a set of movements. By following the instructions above, you can easily set up and run the application to meet your scoring needs.
