Read integers N, A, B, and C from standard input. Initialize a 2D array 'D' of size N x N to store the travel times between cities. Populate the 'D' array with the travel times for each pair of cities (i, j) from standard input. Initialize a distance array 'min_time' of size N, setting 'min_time[1] = 0' (starting city) and all other entries to infinity. Use a priority queue to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path:\n   - For each city, calculate the time to travel to all other cities using both transportation methods:\n     - For company car: 'time_car = D[i][j] * A'\n     - For train: 'time_train = D[i][j] * B + C'\n   - Update the 'min_time' array accordingly based on the minimum time found. Ensure that switching from company car to train is allowed without time penalty. Continue until all reachable cities have been processed. The minimum time to reach city N will be stored in 'min_time[N]'. Print the minimum time from city 1 to city N. Ensure that the algorithm handles the constraints efficiently, given the maximum values for N and D.
