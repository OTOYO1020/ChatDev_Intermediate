# Building Visibility Application

A Python application to determine the number of visible buildings based on their heights.

## Main Functions

The Building Visibility application provides the following main functions:

- **count_visible_buildings(N: int, H: List[int]) -> List[int]**: This function takes an integer `N` (the number of buildings) and a list of integers `H` (the heights of the buildings) and returns a list of integers representing the count of visible buildings for each building.

## Quick Install

To run the Building Visibility application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application code.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main file to start the application.

```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Input Handling**: 
   - When prompted, enter the number of buildings (N).
   - Then, enter the heights of the buildings as a comma-separated list (e.g., `3, 5, 2, 4`).

4. **Output**: The application will output a list of integers, each representing the count of visible buildings for the corresponding building.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter number of buildings (N): 4
Enter heights of buildings (comma-separated): 3,5,2,4
[2, 1, 1, 0]
```

In this example, the output `[2, 1, 1, 0]` indicates:
- The first building can see 2 buildings (the second and the third).
- The second building can see 1 building (the third).
- The third building can see 1 building (the fourth).
- The fourth building cannot see any buildings.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:
- If the number of heights entered does not match the specified number of buildings, a `ValueError` will be raised.
- Any other exceptions will be caught and displayed as an error message.

## Conclusion

The Building Visibility application is a simple yet effective tool for determining the visibility of buildings based on their heights. Feel free to modify and enhance the code as per your requirements. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
