Task:
Define a function 'count_visible_buildings(N: int, H: List[int]) -> List[int]' that takes an integer N and a list of integers H representing the heights of the buildings. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list of heights H from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'result' to store the count of visible buildings for each building. Iterate through each building index 'i' from 1 to N (0 to N-1 in 0-based index). For each building 'i', initialize a variable 'max_height' to keep track of the maximum height encountered between buildings 'i' and 'j'. For each building index 'j' from 'i+1' to N, check if the height of building 'j' is greater than 'max_height'. If the height of building 'j' is greater than 'max_height', increment the count for building 'i' and update 'max_height' to the height of building 'j'. After processing all buildings for a given 'i', append the count to the 'result' list. Return the 'result' list containing the counts of visible buildings for each building. Ensure that the output format is a list of integers, each representing the count of visible buildings for the corresponding building.
