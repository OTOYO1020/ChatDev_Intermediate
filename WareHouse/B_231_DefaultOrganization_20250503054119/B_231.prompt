Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of voters. Initialize a dictionary 'vote_count' to keep track of the number of votes for each candidate. Loop from 1 to N to read each candidate's name 'S_i' from standard input.\n   - For each candidate name, update the 'vote_count' dictionary by incrementing the count for 'S_i'. Initialize variables 'max_votes' to track the maximum number of votes and 'winner' to store the name of the winning candidate. Iterate through the 'vote_count' dictionary to determine the candidate with the highest vote count:\n   - If the current candidate's vote count exceeds 'max_votes', update 'max_votes' and set 'winner' to the current candidate's name. After processing all votes, the 'winner' variable will contain the name of the candidate with the most votes. Print the name of the candidate stored in 'winner'.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output will be a single line containing the name of the candidate who received the most votes.
