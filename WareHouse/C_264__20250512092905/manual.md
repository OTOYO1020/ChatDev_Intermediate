# Matrix Transformation Checker

A simple application to determine if one matrix can be transformed into another by removing rows and columns.

## Main Functions

The software provides the following functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads dimensions and elements for two matrices (A and B).
- **Transformation Check**: Determines if matrix A can be transformed into matrix B by generating all possible submatrices of A and checking for a match with B.
- **Output Handling**: Prints "Yes" if transformation is possible, otherwise prints "No".

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Dimensions**:
   When prompted, enter the dimensions for Matrix A and Matrix B in the format `H W` (e.g., `3 3` for a 3x3 matrix).

3. **Input Elements**:
   After entering the dimensions, you will be prompted to enter the elements of both matrices. Enter the elements as space-separated integers.

4. **View Results**:
   The application will output "Yes" if Matrix A can be transformed into Matrix B, otherwise it will output "No".

## Example Usage

```
Enter dimensions for Matrix A (H W): 3 3
Enter dimensions for Matrix B (H W): 2 2
Enter 9 elements for Matrix A (space-separated):
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Enter 4 elements for Matrix B (space-separated):
5 6 8 9
Yes, transformation is possible.
```

## Edge Cases Handled

- The application checks for valid positive integer dimensions.
- It ensures that the number of elements provided matches the specified dimensions.
- It handles cases where Matrix A is already equal to Matrix B.

## Future Enhancements

This application can be extended with additional features such as:

- Support for larger matrices with more complex transformation rules.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Integration with databases for storing and retrieving matrices.

For any issues or feature requests, please contact the support team.
