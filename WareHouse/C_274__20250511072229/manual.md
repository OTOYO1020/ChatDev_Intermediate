# Gomoku Game

A simple and interactive Gomoku game implemented in Python, allowing two players to compete against each other in a classic board game format.

## Quick Install

To run the Gomoku game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can clone the repository or download the files directly. Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:

- `gomoku_game.py`
- `gomoku_gui.py`
- `main.py`

## ü§î What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a traditional board game where two players take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first to get five of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## üì¶ Environment Dependencies

This game does not require any additional dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the game files are located, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Interface**: The game will display the current state of the board in the console. Each cell is represented by a space (' '), and players will take turns entering their moves.

3. **Making a Move**: 
   - When prompted, enter the row and column numbers (0-14) where you want to place your mark.
   - Example: To place your mark in the top-left corner, enter `0` for the row and `0` for the column.

4. **Winning the Game**: The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player gets five in a row, the game will announce the winner. If the board is full and no player has won, the game will declare a draw.

5. **Playing Again**: After the game ends, you will be prompted to play again. Enter `yes` to start a new game or `no` to exit.

## üìú Game Rules

- Players alternate turns, with Player X going first.
- A player wins by placing five of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
