Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the maximum number of turns in the game. Initialize a variable 'expected_score' to store the expected value of the score. Create a loop that iterates from turn 1 to N:\n   - For each turn, simulate rolling a 6-sided die to get a value X (1 to 6). Calculate the expected score for the current turn:\n   - If it is the last turn (N-th turn), the expected score is simply X.\n   - If it is not the last turn, compute the expected value of continuing the game versus ending it:\n     - Calculate the expected value of continuing the game by averaging the possible outcomes of the next roll.\n     - Compare this value with the current score X to decide whether to continue or end the game. Update 'expected_score' with the maximum of the current score X and the expected value of continuing. After the loop, print the final value of 'expected_score' rounded to an appropriate precision (e.g., two decimal places).\n\nThis structure ensures that the game is simulated correctly, and the expected value is calculated based on the rules provided.
