Task:
Define the function 'countKnightWays(X: int, Y: int) -> int' to calculate the number of ways the knight can reach the square (X, Y). Implement input handling to read integers X and Y from standard input. Initialize a 2D list 'dp' of size (X+1) by (Y+1) to store the number of ways to reach each square (i, j). Set the base case 'dp[0][0] = 1' since there is one way to be at the starting position (0, 0). Iterate through each square (i, j) in the grid up to (X, Y) and calculate the number of ways to reach (i, j) using the knight's moves. For each square (i, j), update 'dp[i+1][j+2]' and 'dp[i+2][j+1]' by adding the number of ways to reach (i, j) modulo (10^9 + 7). Ensure that the indices do not exceed the bounds of the dp array when updating for knight moves. Return the value of 'dp[X][Y]' as the result, which represents the number of ways to reach the square (X, Y). Implement output handling to print the result of 'countKnightWays(X, Y)'. Ensure that the function handles large values of X and Y efficiently within the constraints.
