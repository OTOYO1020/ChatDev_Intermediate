Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of houses and the number of movements, respectively. Read the coordinates of N houses into a list of tuples 'houses' where each tuple is '(X_i, Y_i)'. Read the starting coordinates of Santa Claus into variables 'S_x' and 'S_y'. Initialize a set 'visited_houses' to keep track of distinct houses that Santa passes through or arrives at. Initialize current position variables 'current_x' and 'current_y' with 'S_x' and 'S_y'. For each movement 'D_i' and corresponding distance 'C_i' in the sequence:\n   - Update 'current_x' and 'current_y' based on the direction 'D_i':\n     - If 'D_i' is 'U', set 'current_y = current_y + C_i'.\n     - If 'D_i' is 'D', set 'current_y = current_y - C_i'.\n     - If 'D_i' is 'L', set 'current_x = current_x - C_i'.\n     - If 'D_i' is 'R', set 'current_x = current_x + C_i'.\n   - Check if the new position '(current_x, current_y)' matches any house in 'houses' and add it to 'visited_houses'. After processing all movements, calculate the number of distinct houses visited by taking the length of 'visited_houses'. Print the final position '(current_x, current_y)' after all movements. Print the count of distinct houses visited.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that we handle the input correctly, track Santa's movements, and count the distinct houses efficiently.
