## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The software reads the number of houses and movements, as well as their respective coordinates and directions.
- **Movement Tracking**: It updates Santa's position based on the movements provided and keeps track of all distinct houses visited.
- **Output**: After processing all movements, the software outputs Santa's final position and the count of distinct houses visited.

## Installation

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

   ```

2. **Input the Number of Houses**: When prompted, enter the number of houses (N) as an integer.

3. **Input the Number of Movements**: Next, enter the number of movements (M) as an integer.

4. **Input House Coordinates**: For each house, input the coordinates in the format `x,y`. For example:
   ```
   Enter house coordinates (x,y): 1,2
   ```

5. **Input Santa's Starting Position**: Enter Santa's starting position in the same `x,y` format:
   ```
   Enter Santa's starting position (x,y): 0,0
   ```

6. **Input Movements**: For each movement, input the direction (U, D, L, R) and distance (C) in the format `D,C`. For example:
   ```
   Enter movement (D,C): U,5
   ```

7. **View Results**: After all movements have been entered, the program will display Santa's final position and the number of distinct houses visited.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of houses: 3
Enter the number of movements: 4
Enter house coordinates (x,y): 1,2
Enter house coordinates (x,y): 2,3
Enter house coordinates (x,y): 3,4
Enter Santa's starting position (x,y): 0,0
Enter movement (D,C): R,2
Enter movement (D,C): U,3
Enter movement (D,C): L,1
Enter movement (D,C): D,1
```

### Expected Output
