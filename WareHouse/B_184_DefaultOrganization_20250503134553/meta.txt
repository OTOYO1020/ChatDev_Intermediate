Task:
Read integers N and X from standard input, where N represents the number of quiz questions and X represents the initial points. Read the string S from standard input, which consists of characters 'o' (correct answer) and 'x' (incorrect answer). Initialize a variable 'points' with the value of X to keep track of Takahashi's current points. Iterate over each character in the string S using a loop:\n   - For each character:\n     - If the character is 'o', increment 'points' by 1.\n     - If the character is 'x':\n       - Check if 'points' is greater than 0:\n         - If true, decrement 'points' by 1.\n         - If false, do nothing (points remain the same). After processing all characters in S, the final value of 'points' will represent Takahashi's total points. Print the final value of 'points' as the output.
