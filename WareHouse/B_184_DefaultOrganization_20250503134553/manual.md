# Quiz Points Calculator

A simple application to calculate final points based on quiz answers.

## Introduction

The Quiz Points Calculator allows users to input the number of quiz questions, initial points, and a string of answers consisting of 'o' (correct answers) and 'x' (incorrect answers). The application processes the answers and calculates the final points based on the rules provided.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the number of questions (N) is a positive integer, the initial points (X) are non-negative, and the answers string (S) contains only 'o' and 'x'.
- **Points Calculation**: Iterates through the answers string to calculate the final points based on correct and incorrect answers.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts the user for input and provides feedback on any input errors.

## Installation

To run the Quiz Points Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies, install them using pip. For this application, no external dependencies are required beyond Python itself.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   (Note: If there is no `requirements.txt`, you can skip this step.)

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Questions (N)**: When prompted, enter the number of quiz questions as a positive integer.

3. **Input the Initial Points (X)**: Enter the initial points as a non-negative integer.

4. **Input the Answers String (S)**: Enter a string consisting of 'o' and 'x'. The length of this string must match the number of questions (N) you entered earlier.

5. **View Final Points**: After processing the input, the application will display the final points based on the answers provided.

## Example Usage

```
Please enter the number of quiz questions (N, positive integer): 5
Please enter the initial points (X, non-negative integer): 3
Please enter the answers string (S) consisting of 'o' and 'x': ooxxo
Final Points: 4
```

## Error Handling

- If the input for N is not a positive integer, the application will prompt an error message and ask for input again.
- If the input for X is not a non-negative integer, the application will prompt an error message and ask for input again.
- If the answers string (S) contains characters other than 'o' and 'x', or if its length does not match N, the application will prompt an error message and ask for input again.
