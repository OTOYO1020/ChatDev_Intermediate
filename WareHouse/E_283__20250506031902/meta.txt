Task:
Read the dimensions of the matrix, H and W, from standard input. Read the matrix A of size H x W, ensuring each element A[i][j] is either 0 or 1. Initialize a variable 'operations' to count the number of operations performed. Define a function 'is_isolated(i, j)' to check if the element A[i][j] is isolated based on its adjacent elements. Loop through each element in the matrix A:\n   - For each element A[i][j], call 'is_isolated(i, j)'.\n   - If A[i][j] is isolated, increment the 'operations' counter and perform the operation to flip the entire row i. After processing the matrix, check if any elements remain isolated:\n   - If any element is still isolated, print Impossible and exit. If all elements are non-isolated, print the total number of operations performed. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as matrices with all elements the same. Optimize the operation count by determining if flipping a row can resolve multiple isolated elements at once. Output the final result, which is either the number of operations or Impossible.
