Here's a detailed user manual for the matrix isolation checker software, formatted in Markdown as requested:

# Matrix Isolation Checker

A Python application to check and manipulate a binary matrix (composed of 0s and 1s) to identify isolated elements and perform operations to resolve them.

## Quick Install

To run the Matrix Isolation Checker, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the application directly without any additional dependencies.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Matrix Isolation Checker is designed to read a matrix of binary values (0s and 1s) and determine if any elements are isolated. An element is considered isolated if it is a 1 and all its adjacent elements (up, down, left, right) are 0 or out of bounds. The application will perform operations to flip entire rows of the matrix to resolve isolated elements.

### Main Functions

- **Input Dimensions**: Read the dimensions of the matrix (H x W) from standard input.
- **Input Matrix**: Read the matrix elements ensuring they are either 0 or 1.
- **Check Isolation**: Identify isolated elements using the `is_isolated(i, j)` function.
- **Row Flipping**: Flip entire rows of the matrix to resolve isolated elements.
- **Operation Counting**: Count the number of operations performed to resolve isolation.
- **Output Result**: Print the total number of operations or "Impossible" if isolation cannot be resolved.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Matrix Dimensions**:
   When prompted, enter the dimensions of the matrix in the format `H W` (e.g., `3 4` for a 3x4 matrix).

3. **Input the Matrix Elements**:
   Enter the matrix elements row by row, ensuring each row contains exactly W elements (0s and 1s). For example:
   ```
   0 1 0 0
   1 0 0 1
   0 0 1 0
   ```

4. **View the Results**:
   After processing, the application will output either the total number of operations performed or "Impossible" if any elements remain isolated.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter dimensions (H W): 3 4
Enter matrix (0s and 1s):
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0
Total operations: 2
```

## Edge Cases

- If the matrix is entirely filled with 0s, the application will output "Total operations: 0".
- If the matrix is entirely filled with 1s, the application will output "Impossible".

## Conclusion

The Matrix Isolation Checker is a straightforward tool for analyzing binary matrices and resolving isolated elements through row operations. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
