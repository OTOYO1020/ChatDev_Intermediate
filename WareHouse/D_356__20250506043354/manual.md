# Bitwise AND and Popcount Calculator

A simple application to compute the total number of 1s in the binary representation of the results of the bitwise AND operation between integers from 0 to N and a given integer M.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter two non-negative integers, N and M.
- **Bitwise AND Calculation**: For each integer k from 0 to N, the application computes the bitwise AND with M.
- **Popcount Calculation**: It counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of the AND result.
- **Final Result**: The total count of 1s is computed and displayed modulo 998244353.

## Quick Install

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Currently, there are no external dependencies required other than Python itself.*

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: 
   Execute the main application file in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Prompt**: 
   You will be prompted to enter two non-negative integers, N and M, separated by a space. For example:

   ```
   Enter two non-negative integers N and M (separated by space) or type 'exit' to quit: 5 3
   ```

3. **Input Validation**: 
   - If you enter invalid input (non-integer or negative values), the application will display an error message and prompt you to enter the values again.
   - You can type 'exit' at any time to quit the application.

4. **Output**: 
   After entering valid integers, the application will compute the final result and display it:

   ```
   Final Result: 8
   ```

## Example Usage

- **Example 1**:
   - Input: `5 3`
   - Output: `Final Result: 8`
   
- **Example 2**:
   - Input: `10 7`
   - Output: `Final Result: 20`

## Additional Information

- **Utility Function**: The application uses a utility function `popcount` defined in `utils.py` to calculate the number of 1s in the binary representation of the AND results.
- **Modular Design**: The application is designed with a modular approach, separating the main logic and utility functions for better maintainability.
