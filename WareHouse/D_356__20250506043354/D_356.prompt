Read integers N and M from standard input. Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to accumulate the results. Loop over each integer 'k' from 0 to N (inclusive):\n   - a. Compute 'and_result = k & M' using the bitwise AND operation.\n   - b. Calculate 'popcount_result = popcount(and_result)' to count the number of 1s in the binary representation of 'and_result'.\n   - c. Update 'total_sum' by adding 'popcount_result'. Compute the final result as 'final_result = total_sum % 998244353'. Print the 'final_result'.
