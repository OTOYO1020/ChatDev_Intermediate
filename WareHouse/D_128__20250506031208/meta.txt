Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input, followed by an array of integers V representing the values of the jewels. Initialize an empty list 'jewels_in_hand' to store the jewels taken from the dequeue. Initialize a variable 'max_sum' to track the maximum possible sum of the values of jewels in 'jewels_in_hand'. Loop through all possible combinations of operations (A, B, C, D) up to K times:\n   - For each operation, check if it can be performed based on the current state of the dequeue and 'jewels_in_hand'.\n   - If performing operation A, remove the leftmost jewel from D and add its value to 'jewels_in_hand'.\n   - If performing operation B, remove the rightmost jewel from D and add its value to 'jewels_in_hand'.\n   - If performing operation C, insert a jewel from 'jewels_in_hand' to the left end of D.\n   - If performing operation D, insert a jewel from 'jewels_in_hand' to the right end of D. After each operation, calculate the current sum of values in 'jewels_in_hand' and update 'max_sum' if the current sum is greater. Ensure that the operations respect the constraints (e.g., not performing operations when D is empty or when 'jewels_in_hand' is empty). After all operations are considered, print the value of 'max_sum'.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output will be a single integer representing the maximum possible sum of the values of jewels in your hands after performing the operations.
