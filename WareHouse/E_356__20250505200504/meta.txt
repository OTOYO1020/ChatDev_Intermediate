Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the sequence A. Read the sequence A of length N from standard input, ensuring all elements are integers within the range [1, 10^6]. Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to store the cumulative result of the nested summation. Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N:\n   - For each pair, calculate 'max_value = max(A[i-1], A[j-1])' and 'min_value = min(A[i-1], A[j-1])'.\n   - Compute the ratio 'ratio = max_value / min_value'.\n   - Apply the floor function to get 'floor_value = floor(ratio)'.\n   - Update 'total_sum' by adding 'floor_value'. After completing the nested loops, print the final value of 'total_sum'.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to be implemented: 'calculate_sum(N, A)'\n- Variables: 'total_sum', 'max_value', 'min_value', 'ratio', 'floor_value', 'i', 'j'. \n\n### Output Format:\n- The output will be a single integer representing the total sum calculated from the nested summation.
