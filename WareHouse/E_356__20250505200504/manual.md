# Nested Summation Calculator

A Python application for calculating the total sum of a nested summation based on a sequence of integers.

## Main Functions

The Nested Summation Calculator provides the following functionalities:

- **Input Reading**: Reads an integer N representing the length of the sequence and the sequence A of integers.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the input integers are within the specified range [1, 10^6].
- **Nested Summation Calculation**: Computes the total sum based on the nested summation logic defined in the task.
- **Output**: Prints the final calculated total sum.

## Installation

To run the Nested Summation Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install math
   ```

   Note: The `math` module is part of the Python standard library, so you typically do not need to install it separately.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: Prepare your input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain a single integer N (the length of the sequence).
   - The second line should contain N space-separated integers representing the sequence A.

   Example input:
   ```
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` using the command line. You can redirect input from a file or provide input directly.

   To run the application, use:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Example**: You can provide input directly in the terminal or redirect from a file. For example, if you have an input file named `input.txt`, you can run:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

4. **View Output**: After running the application, the total sum calculated from the nested summation will be printed to the console.

## Example Usage

Given the following input:
```
4
2 4 6 8
```

The output will be:
```
9
```

This output represents the total sum calculated based on the nested summation logic defined in the application.

## Conclusion

The Nested Summation Calculator is a straightforward tool for performing nested summation calculations on a sequence of integers. Ensure to follow the input format and validation rules for accurate results. For any issues or further assistance, feel free to reach out for support.
