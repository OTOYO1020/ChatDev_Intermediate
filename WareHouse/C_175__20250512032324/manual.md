# Minimum Absolute Coordinate Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum possible absolute value of a destination coordinate based on user-defined parameters.

## Main Functions

The `minimum_absolute_coordinate` function takes three integer inputs: `X`, `K`, and `D`, and computes the minimum possible absolute value of the destination coordinate based on the following logic:

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `X`: The initial coordinate.
   - `K`: The number of moves allowed.
   - `D`: The distance moved in each step.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - If `K` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `X` divided by `D`, the function returns `abs(X) % D`.
   - If `K` is less than `abs(X) // D`, it calculates the remaining distance after making `K` moves towards zero and determines the final position based on whether the remaining distance is even or odd.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Minimum Absolute Coordinate Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not have external dependencies beyond the Python standard library. You can run it directly without additional installations.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter three integers separated by spaces for `X`, `K`, and `D`. For example:
   ```
   Enter X, K, D separated by spaces: 10 3 2
   ```

3. **View Result**: The application will process the input and display the result:
   ```
   Result: <calculated_value>
   ```

## Example Usage

- **Input**: `10 3 2`
- **Output**: `Result: 0`

This indicates that after making 3 moves of distance 2 from the initial coordinate of 10, the minimum absolute coordinate is 0.

## Error Handling

If the input is invalid (non-integer values), the application will display an error message:
```
Input Error: Please enter valid integers for X, K, and D.
```

## Conclusion

The Minimum Absolute Coordinate Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating destination coordinates based on user-defined parameters. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy for users to obtain results quickly.
