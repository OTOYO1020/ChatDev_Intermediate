# Coprime Calculator

A simple application to calculate coprime integers based on user-defined parameters.

## Overview

The Coprime Calculator allows users to input a sequence of positive integers and determine which integers from 1 to M are coprime with all integers in the provided sequence. This application is built using Python and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Main Functions

- **Input Parameters**: Users can input two integers, N (the length of the sequence) and M (the upper limit for checking coprimality), along with a sequence of N positive integers.
- **Coprime Calculation**: The application calculates which integers from 1 to M are coprime with all integers in the sequence.
- **Result Display**: The results are displayed in the GUI, showing all coprime integers found.

## Installation

To run the Coprime Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:

- `tkinter` (for the GUI)

These packages are typically included with Python installations. If you encounter any issues, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to launch the Coprime Calculator.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**:
   - Enter the value for **N** (the number of integers in the sequence).
   - Enter the value for **M** (the upper limit for checking coprimality).
   - Enter the sequence of positive integers **A** as a comma-separated list (e.g., `3, 5, 7`).

3. **Calculate Coprimes**: Click the "Calculate Coprimes" button to perform the calculation.

4. **View Results**: The results will be displayed below the input fields, showing all integers from 1 to M that are coprime with the integers in the sequence A.

## Example Usage

- **Input**:
  - N: 3
  - M: 10
  - A: 3, 5, 7

- **Output**:
  - Coprimes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to ensure that:
- N and M are positive integers.
- The sequence A contains exactly N positive integers.
- All entries in A are valid positive integers.

If any input errors occur, a message will be displayed in the results area.

## Conclusion

The Coprime Calculator is a straightforward tool for determining coprime integers, making it useful for mathematical analysis and educational purposes. For any further questions or support, please refer to the documentation or contact the development team.
