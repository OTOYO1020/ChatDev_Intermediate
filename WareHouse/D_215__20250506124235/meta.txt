Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input. Read the sequence of positive integers A of length N. Initialize an empty list 'result' to store valid integers k. Loop through each integer k from 1 to M (inclusive):\n   - For each k, initialize a flag 'is_coprime' as True.\n   - Loop through each integer A_i in A:\n     - Check if gcd(A_i, k) is not equal to 1:\n       - If true, set 'is_coprime' to False and break the loop.\n   - If 'is_coprime' remains True after checking all A_i, append k to 'result'. Print all integers in 'result' as the output.
