# Word Fitting Application

A simple application designed to determine the minimum width required to fit a given set of words within a specified number of lines.

## Overview

This application reads a list of word widths and calculates the minimum window width necessary to fit all words while adhering to the maximum number of lines allowed. It utilizes a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal width.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: Reads integers N (number of words) and M (maximum number of lines) from standard input, along with an array of integers representing the widths of each word.
2. **Word Fitting Logic**: The `can_fit_in_window(width)` function checks if the words can fit within the specified window width while adhering to the line constraints.
3. **Binary Search**: The `binary_search_min_width(widths, max_lines)` function performs a binary search to find the minimum width required to fit all words within the specified maximum number of lines.

## Installation

To run the Word Fitting Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The application does not require any third-party libraries, so you can run it directly after setting up Python.

### Steps to Install Python

1. Download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Running the Application

1. Clone or download the repository containing the application files (`main.py` and `utils.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the application files are located.
4. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. Input the required values when prompted:
   - First, enter two integers separated by a space (N and M).
   - Next, enter the widths of the words as a space-separated list.

### Example Input

```
5 3
2 3 5 4 1
```

### Example Output

```
The minimum width required is: 8
```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic input validation. If the input does not meet the requirements (e.g., N and M must be positive integers, the number of widths must match N, and all widths must be positive integers), the application will return an error message.

## Conclusion

This Word Fitting Application is a straightforward tool for determining the minimum width needed to display a set of words within a specified number of lines. It is efficient and easy to use, making it suitable for various applications where text layout is a concern.
