Read integers N and M from standard input. Read the integer sequence A of length N from standard input. Initialize a set 'A_set' to store the values of A for efficient lookup. Loop M times to perform the specified operation:\n   - For each index i from 1 to N:\n     - Update the value of A[i] by adding i to it.\n     - Add the updated value to 'A_set'.\n   - After updating all values, find the minimum non-negative integer not present in 'A_set':\n     - Initialize a variable 'min_non_negative' to 0.\n     - While 'min_non_negative' is in 'A_set', increment it. Print the result of the minimum non-negative integer found after M operations.
