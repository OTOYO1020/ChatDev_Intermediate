# Minimum Non-Negative Integer Finder

This application reads a sequence of integers and performs operations to find the minimum non-negative integer not present in the modified sequence. It is designed to efficiently handle the specified operations and provide quick results.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application reads integers N (length of the sequence) and M (number of operations) from standard input.
2. **Sequence Modification**: For M iterations, the application updates each element of the sequence by adding its index to it and stores the updated values in a set for efficient lookup.
3. **Minimum Non-Negative Integer Calculation**: After all operations, the application finds and prints the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the updated set.

## Installation Instructions

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is empty, you can skip this step.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Provide Input**:
   The application will prompt you to enter two integers followed by a sequence of integers. For example:
   ```
   5 3
   0 1 2 3 4
   ```
   Here, `5` is the length of the sequence (N), `3` is the number of operations (M), and `0 1 2 3 4` is the sequence of integers.

3. **View Output**:
   After processing the input, the application will output the minimum non-negative integer not present in the modified sequence.

## Example Usage

### Input:
```
5 3
0 1 2 3 4
```

### Output:
```
15
```

This indicates that after performing the specified operations, the smallest non-negative integer not found in the updated sequence is `15`.
