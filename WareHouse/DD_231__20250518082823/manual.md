# Arrangement Checker

A Python application to determine if a valid arrangement of people is possible based on adjacency conditions.

## Overview

The Arrangement Checker allows users to input the number of people and their adjacency conditions, and it checks if a valid arrangement can be made that satisfies all conditions. This is useful in scenarios where certain individuals must be positioned relative to one another.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user for the number of people (N) and the number of conditions (M). It then collects M pairs of conditions that specify adjacency requirements.
  
- **Graph Representation**: The conditions are represented using a directed graph, where each person is a vertex and each condition is a directed edge.

- **Cycle Detection**: The application checks for cycles in the graph. If a cycle is detected, it indicates that a valid arrangement is impossible.

- **Topological Sorting**: If no cycles are found, the application attempts to create a valid order of people that satisfies all adjacency conditions.

- **Validation**: The constructed order is validated against the original conditions to ensure all are satisfied.

- **Output**: The application returns a boolean value indicating whether a valid arrangement is possible.

## Installation

To run the Arrangement Checker, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**: The application uses the `collections` module, which is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installations are required.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

2. **Execute the Script**: Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of people and conditions:
   - Enter the number of people (N): This should be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - Enter the number of conditions (M): This should be a non-negative integer.
   - If M > 0, enter the conditions as pairs of integers separated by commas (e.g., `1 2, 2 3`).

4. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will output whether a valid arrangement is possible.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter number of people (N): 3
Enter number of conditions (M): 2
Enter conditions as pairs (e.g., '1 2, 2 3'):
1 2, 2 3
A valid arrangement is possible.
```

## Edge Cases

- If M is 0, the application will automatically return that any arrangement is valid.
- The application checks for invalid input formats and will prompt the user accordingly.
