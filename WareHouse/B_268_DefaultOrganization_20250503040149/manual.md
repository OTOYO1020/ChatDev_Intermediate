# Prefix Checking Application

A simple application to determine if one string is a prefix of another.

## Main Functions

The Prefix Checking Application provides the following functionalities:

- **Check Prefix**: Determines if the first string (S) is a prefix of the second string (T).
- **Input Handling**: Prompts the user to input two strings for comparison.
- **Output**: Returns "YES" if S is a prefix of T, otherwise returns "NO" with a descriptive message.

## Installation

To run the Prefix Checking Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application code:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. However, ensure you have a compatible version of Python.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the application files are located, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Strings**: You will be prompted to enter two strings:
   - First, enter the string S (the one you want to check as a prefix).
   - Next, enter the string T (the one you want to check against).

3. **View Results**: After entering the strings, the application will output either "YES" if S is a prefix of T or "NO" with a descriptive message if it is not.

## Example Usage

```
Please enter the first string (S) to check as a prefix: hello
Please enter the second string (T) to check against: hello world
YES
```

```
Please enter the first string (S) to check as a prefix: hello
Please enter the second string (T) to check against: world hello
NO: S is not a prefix of T.
```

## Additional Information

- **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling for empty strings. If either string is empty, it will return a descriptive message indicating that a prefix cannot be checked.
- **Code Structure**: The application consists of two main files:
  - `main.py`: Contains the logic for checking prefixes and handling user input.
  - `string_input.py`: Contains the class responsible for gathering string inputs from the user.
