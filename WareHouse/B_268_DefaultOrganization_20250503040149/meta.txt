Task:
Read the two strings 'S' and 'T' from standard input. Determine the lengths of both strings: 'len_S' for 'S' and 'len_T' for 'T'. Check if 'len_S' is greater than 'len_T'. If true, 'S' cannot be a prefix of 'T'. If 'len_S' is less than or equal to 'len_T', extract the prefix of 'T' that has the same length as 'S', denoted as 'prefix_T = T[:len_S]'. Compare 'S' with 'prefix_T'. If they are equal, 'S' is a prefix of 'T'. Return the result as a boolean value indicating whether 'S' is a prefix of 'T'. Print 'YES' if 'S' is a prefix of 'T', otherwise print 'NO'.
