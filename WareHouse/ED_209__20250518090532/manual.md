## Introduction

The Takahashi Word Game allows two players to compete by saying words from a provided dictionary. The game checks if a word can follow another based on the last three characters of the previous word. The player who cannot say a word loses the game.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Word Game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install any necessary libraries (if applicable).

3. **Prepare the Dictionary File**: Create a text file containing the words for the game, with one word per line. This will serve as your Takahashi Dictionary.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` script to start the game. You can do this by navigating to the directory where the script is located and running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Dictionary File Path**: When prompted, enter the path to your dictionary file. Ensure that the file is accessible and correctly formatted.

3. **View Results**: After processing, the application will display the winner for each starting word in the dictionary.

## Main Functions

### 1. `can_follow(word1, word2)`

This function checks if `word2` can follow `word1` based on the last three characters of `word1`. It handles case sensitivity correctly.

### 2. `determine_winner(start_word)`

This function simulates the game starting with `start_word` and determines the winner, assuming both players play optimally. It returns:
- "Player 1" if Player 1 wins,
- "Player 2" if Player 2 wins,
- "Draw" if all words have been used.

### 3. `load_dictionary(file_path)`

This function loads the words from the specified dictionary file. It returns a list of words or an empty list if the file does not exist or is empty.

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Found**: If you receive an error stating that the dictionary file does not exist, ensure that the path you provided is correct and that the file is accessible.

- **Empty Dictionary**: If the application indicates that the dictionary is empty, check the contents of your dictionary file to ensure it has words listed correctly.

- **Game Logic Issues**: If you notice any discrepancies in the game logic, please review the code in `game.py` for potential bugs or logical errors.
