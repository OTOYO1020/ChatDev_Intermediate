Task:
Parse the input to read the integer N and the list of words s_i from the Takahashi Dictionary. Implement a function 'can_follow(word1, word2)' that checks if word2 can be said after word1 based on the last three characters. Create a function 'determine_winner(start_word)' that simulates the game starting with start_word and determines the winner assuming both players play optimally. Iterate through each word in the dictionary and call 'determine_winner(s_i)' to find out the winner for each starting word. Store the results of the winners in a list or array. Format the output to match the required output format, indicating the winner for each starting word. Ensure that the function handles case sensitivity correctly when checking for valid words. Implement a mechanism to handle the case where a player cannot say a word, leading to their loss. Optimize the solution to handle the upper limit of N efficiently, ensuring that the game simulation runs in a reasonable time. Output the results in the specified format after processing all starting words.
