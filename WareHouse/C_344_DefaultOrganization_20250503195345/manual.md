# Possible Sums Calculator

This software computes all possible sums from three sequences of integers and checks if specified queries exist within those sums.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers N, M, L, and Q, along with sequences A, B, C, and the query sequence X.
- **Sum Computation**: Calculates all possible sums of one element from each of the sequences A, B, and C.
- **Query Checking**: For each query in sequence X, checks if it exists in the computed possible sums and returns "YES" or "NO".

## Quick Install

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: The `requirements.txt` file is currently empty but can be updated in the future if additional dependencies are needed.*

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the `main.py` script using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   The program expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain four integers: `N`, `M`, `L`, and `Q`.
   - The second line should contain `N` integers representing sequence A.
   - The third line should contain `M` integers representing sequence B.
   - The fourth line should contain `L` integers representing sequence C.
   - The fifth line should contain `Q` integers representing the query sequence X.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   3 3 3 2
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   10 15
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The program will output "YES" or "NO" for each query in sequence X, indicating whether each query exists in the set of possible sums.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   YES
   NO
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The software is designed to efficiently compute sums using a set to store unique sums, which allows for quick lookup when checking queries.
- The current implementation uses standard input for reading data, making it suitable for command-line execution.

## Future Enhancements

- The software can be extended to include additional features such as:
  - Support for larger datasets with optimized algorithms.
  - A graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
  - Additional functionalities for more complex queries.

For any issues or feature requests, please contact the support team.
