Task:
Read the string 'S' and the integer 'K' from standard input. Initialize a variable 'max_consecutive_X' to track the maximum number of consecutive 'X's found. Use a sliding window approach to iterate through the string 'S':\n   - Maintain two pointers, 'left' and 'right', to represent the current window of characters. For each position of 'right', check if the character is '.':\n   - If it is a '.', increment a counter 'dot_count'. If 'dot_count' exceeds 'K', move the 'left' pointer to the right until 'dot_count' is less than or equal to 'K'. Calculate the length of the current window as 'right - left + 1' and update 'max_consecutive_X' if this length is greater than the current maximum. Continue this process until the 'right' pointer has traversed the entire string 'S'. After the loop, 'max_consecutive_X' will contain the maximum possible number of consecutive 'X's after performing the operations. Print the value of 'max_consecutive_X' as the final output.
