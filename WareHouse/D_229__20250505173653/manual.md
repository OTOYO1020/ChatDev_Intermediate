# Consecutive 'X' Calculator

This software calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'X's in a given string, allowing for a specified number of '.' characters to be converted into 'X's.

## Main Functions

- **Calculate Maximum Consecutive 'X's**: The core function of the software that takes a string `S` and an integer `K` as input and returns the maximum number of consecutive 'X's that can be achieved by converting up to `K` '.' characters into 'X's.

## Quick Install

To run the consecutive 'X' calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: As of now, there are no specific external dependencies required for this software, but this command is included for future scalability.)

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: 
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input the String and Integer**:
   - When prompted, enter the string `S` that you want to analyze. This string should contain characters 'X' and '.'.
   - Next, enter the integer `K`, which represents the maximum number of '.' characters that can be converted into 'X's. Ensure that `K` is a non-negative integer.

3. **View the Result**:
   - After entering the inputs, the program will process the data and output the maximum number of consecutive 'X's that can be achieved.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter string S: X..XX.X..X
Enter integer K (non-negative): 2
Max Consecutive X's: 5
```

In this example, the input string `X..XX.X..X` allows for converting 2 '.' characters into 'X's, resulting in a maximum of 5 consecutive 'X's.

## Error Handling

- If you enter a negative integer for `K`, the program will prompt you to enter a non-negative integer.
- If the input string is empty, the program will return `0` as the maximum consecutive 'X's.

## Conclusion

The Consecutive 'X' Calculator is a simple yet powerful tool for analyzing strings with specific character conditions. It utilizes a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the desired output.
