## ðŸ¤” What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a board game where two players take turns placing their markers (X and O) on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first to get five of your markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## ðŸ“– Main Functions

### Game Logic

- **GomokuGame Class**: Contains the core logic for managing the game state, including:
  - `make_move(row, col)`: Places a marker on the board.
  - `check_winner(row, col)`: Checks if the current move resulted in a win.
  - `reset_game()`: Resets the game to its initial state.
  - `print_board()`: Displays the current state of the board in the console.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- **GomokuGUI Class**: Provides a graphical interface for the game using Tkinter, including:
  - A 15x15 grid of buttons representing the game board.
  - A status label indicating the current player or the winner.
  - A reset button to start a new game.

### Main Entry Point

- **main.py**: The main script to run the game in console mode. It allows players to make moves via command line input.

## How to Play
