Define a function 'is_subsequence(s: str, t: str) -> bool' to check if string 't' is a subsequence of string 's'. Implement a function 'find_minimum_i(s: str, t: str) -> int' that will determine the minimum integer 'i' such that 't' is a subsequence of the first 'i' characters of the concatenated string 's''. Calculate the length of string 's' and store it in a variable 'len_s'. Calculate the length of string 't' and store it in a variable 'len_t'. Iterate through the characters of 's' to create a mapping of character positions for efficient subsequence checking. Simulate the concatenation of 's' by determining how many full copies of 's' are needed to cover the characters of 't'. For each character in 't', find its corresponding position in the concatenated string 's'' using the mapping created in subtask 5. Keep track of the total number of characters processed from 's'' to find the minimum 'i' that satisfies the subsequence condition. Return '-1' if no valid 'i' is found, otherwise return the minimum 'i' found. Define the input format to read strings 's' and 't' from standard input and the output format to print the result of 'find_minimum_i(s, t)'.
