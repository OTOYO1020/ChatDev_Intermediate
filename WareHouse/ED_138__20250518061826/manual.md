# Subsequence Checker

A Python application to determine if one string is a subsequence of another and to find the minimum index required for the subsequence in a concatenated string.

## Main Functions

1. **is_subsequence(s: str, t: str) -> bool**
   - Checks if string `t` is a subsequence of string `s`.
   - Returns `True` if `t` is a subsequence, otherwise returns `False`.

2. **find_minimum_i(s: str, t: str) -> int**
   - Determines the minimum integer `i` such that `t` is a subsequence of the first `i` characters of the concatenated string `s`.
   - Returns `-1` if no valid `i` is found, otherwise returns the minimum `i`.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone the repository containing the application files:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**
   - Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Strings**
   - When prompted, enter the string `s` followed by the string `t`:
   ```
   Enter string s: <your_string_s>
   Enter string t: <your_string_t>
   ```

4. **View Results**
   - The application will output the minimum index `i` or indicate if no valid `i` was found:
   ```
   The minimum i is: <minimum_i>
   ```

## Example Usage

- If you enter:
  ```
  Enter string s: abc
  Enter string t: ac
  ```
  The output will be:
  ```
  The minimum i is: 4
  ```

- If `t` cannot be formed from `s`, the output will be:
  ```
  No valid i found.
  ```

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple and efficient way to check for subsequences and determine the necessary index in a concatenated string. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
