# Step Climbing Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of ways to climb a staircase with broken steps.

## Overview

The Step Climbing Calculator allows users to input the total number of steps and any broken steps, and it calculates the number of distinct ways to reach the top of the staircase while avoiding the broken steps. The application uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the total number of steps (N) and the number of broken steps (M) from the user. It also collects a list of broken steps.
- **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: Computes the number of ways to climb the staircase using a dynamic programming approach while considering the broken steps.
- **Output**: Displays the total number of ways to reach the N-th step modulo \(1,000,000,007\).

## Installation

To run the Step Climbing Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a Git repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not already provided) and install any necessary libraries. For this application, you may not need any external libraries, but you can prepare for future use by including common libraries. For example:
   ```plaintext
   # requirements.txt
   # Optional libraries for future use
   numpy
   pandas
   ```

   Install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Step Climbing Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Total Steps (N)**: When prompted, enter the total number of steps you want to climb. This must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Input the Number of Broken Steps (M)**: Enter the number of broken steps. This must also be a non-negative integer.

4. **Input the Broken Steps**: If there are any broken steps, enter them as a comma-separated list. Ensure that the broken steps are within the range of 0 to N inclusive.

5. **View the Result**: After entering the inputs, the application will calculate and display the number of ways to climb the staircase while avoiding the broken steps.

## Example

```
Enter total steps (N): 5
Enter number of broken steps (M): 2
Enter broken steps (comma-separated): 2,4
Ways to climb: 3
```

In this example, there are 3 distinct ways to climb to the 5th step while avoiding the broken steps at 2 and 4.

## Conclusion

The Step Climbing Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating climbing paths while considering obstacles. It utilizes efficient algorithms to ensure quick calculations even for larger values of N. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
