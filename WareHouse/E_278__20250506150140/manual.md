# Blackout Counting Program

A Python application for counting distinct integers in a grid after applying blackout operations.

## Overview

This program allows users to input a grid of integers and specify blackout dimensions. It then calculates the number of distinct integers visible after applying blackout operations at various starting positions within the grid.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Read grid dimensions, blackout dimensions, and grid values from standard input.
- **Grid Population**: Populate a 2D array with integers based on user input.
- **Distinct Count Calculation**: Calculate the number of distinct integers visible after each blackout operation.
- **Output**: Display the results of distinct counts for each blackout operation.

## Installation

To run the Blackout Counting Program, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This program does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the `main.py` file using Python.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Required Values**:
   - You will be prompted to enter the following:
     - Height of the grid (H)
     - Width of the grid (W)
     - Number of integers (N) (Note: This value is not directly used in the program but can be useful for validation)
     - Blackout Height (h)
     - Blackout Width (w)
   - Ensure that the blackout dimensions do not exceed the grid dimensions.

4. **Populate the Grid**: After entering the dimensions, you will be prompted to enter the grid values row by row. Input the integers as space-separated values.

5. **View Results**: After processing, the program will output the distinct counts for each blackout operation.

### Example Input

```
Enter Height (H): 4
Enter Width (W): 5
Enter Number of Integers (N): 20
Enter Blackout Height (h): 2
Enter Blackout Width (w): 2
Enter the grid values row by row (space-separated):
Row 1: 1 2 3 4 5
Row 2: 6 7 8 9 10
Row 3: 1 2 3 4 5
Row 4: 6 7 8 9 10
```

### Example Output

```
Distinct Counts: 10, 10, 10, 10
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Input Error**: If you enter invalid integers or the wrong number of integers for a row, the program will raise a `ValueError`. Ensure that all inputs are integers and that each row contains the correct number of integers.
- **Blackout Dimensions Error**: If the blackout dimensions exceed the grid dimensions, an error message will be displayed, and the program will terminate.
