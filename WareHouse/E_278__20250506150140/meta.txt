Task:
Read integers H, W, N, h, and w from standard input. Initialize a 2D array 'A' of size H x W to store the integers on the grid. Populate the grid 'A' by reading H rows of W integers. Initialize a variable 'distinct_count' to store the results for each blackout operation. Loop over all possible starting positions '(k, l)' where '0 ≤ k ≤ H-h' and '0 ≤ l ≤ W-w':\n   - For each '(k, l)', create a set 'visible_numbers' to track distinct integers not blacked out.\n   - Loop through the grid and add integers from 'A[i][j]' to 'visible_numbers' if they are not in the blackout area defined by '(k, l)' and '(k+h, l+w)'. After processing each '(k, l)', store the size of 'visible_numbers' in 'distinct_count'. Print the results stored in 'distinct_count' for each blackout operation.\n\nThe function to handle the input and processing could be named 'count_distinct_numbers(H, W, N, h, w, A)', where 'A' is the 2D array of integers. The output format will be a list of integers representing the count of distinct numbers for each blackout operation.
