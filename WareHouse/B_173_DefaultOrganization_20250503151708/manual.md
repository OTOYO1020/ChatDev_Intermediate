# Verdict Counter Application

This application is designed to count the verdicts from multiple test cases entered by the user. It provides a simple interface for users to input verdicts and receive counts for each type of verdict.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer input representing the number of test cases and validates it to ensure it is a positive integer.
- **Verdict Counting**: Users can input verdicts, and the application counts occurrences of each verdict type: 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', and 'RE'.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring that only valid verdicts are counted.
- **Output**: After processing all inputs, the application prints the counts of each verdict type in a specified format.

## Installation Instructions

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Verify Installation**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python is installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, as it uses built-in Python functionalities. However, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Test Cases**: When prompted, enter a positive integer representing the number of test cases you wish to input.

3. **Input Verdicts**: After entering the number of test cases, you will be prompted to enter the verdicts. Input exactly the number of verdicts specified, ensuring that each verdict is one of the following: 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'.

4. **View Results**: Once all verdicts are entered, the application will output the counts for each verdict type in the format:
   ```
   count_AC count_WA count_TLE count_RE
   ```

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of test cases (positive integer): 5
Please enter exactly 5 verdicts (valid options: AC, WA, TLE, RE):
AC
WA
TLE
AC
RE
2 1 1 1
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter a non-integer value for the number of test cases or an unrecognized verdict, the application will prompt you with an error message and ask for valid input.
- **Count Mismatch**: Ensure that the number of verdicts entered matches the number specified at the beginning. The application will not proceed until the correct number of valid verdicts is provided.

## Conclusion

This Verdict Counter Application is a straightforward tool for counting specific verdicts based on user input. It is designed to be user-friendly and includes error handling to guide users through the input process. For any further questions or support, please contact the development team.
