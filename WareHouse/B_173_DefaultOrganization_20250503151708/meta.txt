Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. Initialize counters for each verdict: 'count_AC', 'count_WA', 'count_TLE', and 'count_RE' to zero. Loop through each test case index 'i' from 1 to N:\n   - Read the string 'S_i' representing the verdict for the test case.\n   - Check the value of 'S_i' and increment the corresponding counter:\n     - If 'S_i' is 'AC', increment 'count_AC'.\n     - If 'S_i' is 'WA', increment 'count_WA'.\n     - If 'S_i' is 'TLE', increment 'count_TLE'.\n     - If 'S_i' is 'RE', increment 'count_RE'. After processing all test cases, prepare the output in the format: 'count_AC count_WA count_TLE count_RE'. Print the output.
