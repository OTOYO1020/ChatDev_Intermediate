Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of vertices in the tree. Initialize a list or array 'degree' of size N+1 to keep track of the degree of each vertex (index 0 will be unused). For each of the N-1 edges, read the pair of integers (a_i, b_i) from standard input. For each edge (a_i, b_i):\n   - Increment 'degree[a_i]' by 1.\n   - Increment 'degree[b_i]' by 1. Count the number of vertices with a degree of N-1 (the center of the star) and the number of vertices with a degree of 1 (the leaves of the star). If there is exactly one vertex with degree N-1 and N-2 vertices with degree 1, then the tree is a star. Return 'YES' if the tree is a star, otherwise return 'NO'. Print the result.\n\n### Function and Variable Names\n- Function: 'is_star_tree(degree)'\n- Variable: 'degree', 'N', 'a_i', 'b_i'
