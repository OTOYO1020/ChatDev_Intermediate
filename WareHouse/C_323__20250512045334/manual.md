# Score Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum number of problems each player must solve to exceed the scores of other players.

## Main Functions

The Score Calculator application provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Player and Problem Data**: Users can input the number of players, number of problems, scores for each problem, and the problems each player has solved.
- **Calculate Minimum Problems**: The application calculates the minimum number of unsolved problems each player must solve to exceed the maximum score of other players.
- **Display Results**: The results are displayed in a user-friendly format, showing the minimum number of problems each player needs to solve.

## Installation

To run the Score Calculator application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

     - **Number of Problems (M)**: Enter the total number of problems.
     - **Scores (comma-separated)**: Enter the scores for each problem, separated by commas (e.g., `10,20,30`).
     - **Solved Problems (comma-separated)**: Enter the indices of the problems each player has solved, separated by commas (e.g., `0,1` for player 1).

3. **Calculate Scores**:
   - Click the **Calculate** button to compute the minimum number of problems each player must solve to exceed the scores of other players.

4. **View Results**:
   - The results will be displayed in the text area below the button, showing the minimum number of problems each player needs to solve.

## Example Usage

- **Input**:
  - Number of Players (N): `3`
  - Number of Problems (M): `3`
  - Scores: `10,20,30`
  - Solved Problems: `0,1,2`
  
- **Output**:
  - Minimum Problems to Solve: `[0, 0, 0]` (indicating that all players have already solved all problems)

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling. If invalid inputs are provided (e.g., non-integer values or out-of-range problem indices), an error message will be displayed in the results area.

## Conclusion

The Score Calculator is a straightforward tool for evaluating player performance based on problem-solving scores. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides immediate feedback on player standings.
