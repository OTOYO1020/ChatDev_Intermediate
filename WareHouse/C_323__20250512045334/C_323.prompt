Define the function 'calculate_min_problems_to_solve(N: int, M: int, scores: List[int], solved: List[str]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the number of players 'N', number of problems 'M', the list of scores 'scores', and the list of strings 'solved' representing solved problems. Initialize a list 'total_scores' to store the total score for each player, calculated as the sum of scores of solved problems plus their bonus score (player index). For each player 'i', iterate through their corresponding string 'solved[i]' to calculate their total score based on the problems they have solved. For each player 'i', determine the maximum score among all other players to find the target score that player 'i' needs to exceed. Calculate the minimum number of unsolved problems that player 'i' must solve to exceed the maximum score of other players, considering the scores of the unsolved problems. Store the result for each player 'i' in a list 'results' that will hold the minimum number of problems to solve for each player. Return the list 'results' containing the minimum number of problems each player must solve to exceed all other players' scores. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as the minimum and maximum constraints for 'N', 'M', and scores. Output the results in the format of a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of problems to solve for each player.
