# Cumulative Product Sum Calculator

A simple Python application to calculate the cumulative sum of products of integer pairs from user input.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter a number of integers and validates the input.
- **Cumulative Product Calculation**: It computes the sum of products for all unique pairs of integers in the provided list.
- **Output**: Displays the final cumulative sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Installation

To run the Cumulative Product Sum Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Integers**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \(N\) which represents the number of integers you will input.

3. **Input the Integers**: You will be prompted to enter exactly \(N\) integers separated by spaces. Ensure that you provide the correct number of integers as specified.

4. **View the Result**: After processing the input, the application will calculate and display the cumulative sum of products of all unique pairs of integers.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of integers: 3
Please enter exactly 3 integers (separated by spaces): 1 2 3
The cumulative sum of products is: 11
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-integer value, the application will prompt you to enter valid integers.
- If the number of integers entered does not match \(N\), you will be asked to try again.
- The application allows a maximum of 3 attempts for input validation before terminating.

## Conclusion

This application is a straightforward tool for calculating the cumulative sum of products of integer pairs. It is designed for ease of use and provides clear prompts for user input. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
