Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of integers. Read the array A of size N containing integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N from standard input. Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to store the cumulative sum of products. Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N:\n   - For each pair, compute the product 'product = A[i] * A[j]'.\n   - Update 'total_sum' with 'total_sum = (total_sum + product) % (10^9 + 7)'. After processing all pairs, print the final value of 'total_sum'.
