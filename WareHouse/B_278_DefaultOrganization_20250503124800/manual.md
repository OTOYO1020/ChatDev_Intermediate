# Confusing Time Finder

A simple application to find the next confusing time based on the current time input.

## Introduction

The Confusing Time Finder is a Python application that checks for "confusing" times in a 24-hour format. A confusing time is defined as a time that, when certain digits are swapped, results in another valid time. This application allows users to input their current time and find the next confusing time.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Time**: The application prompts the user to enter the current time in hours (0-23) and minutes (0-59).
2. **Check Confusing Time**: The application checks if the current time is confusing by swapping specific digits and verifying if the new time is valid.
3. **Increment Time**: If the current time is not confusing, the application increments the time by one minute and checks again.
4. **Output**: The application outputs the next confusing time found or indicates if no confusing time is found within a day.

## Installation

To run the Confusing Time Finder, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Current Time**: When prompted, enter the current hours and minutes. Make sure to enter valid values (0-23 for hours and 0-59 for minutes).

   ```
   Enter Hours (0-23): 12
   Enter Minutes (0-59): 30
   ```

3. **View Results**: The application will check for the next confusing time and display it in the format `H:M`. If no confusing time is found within a day, it will notify you.

   ```
   Next Confusing Time found: 12:03 (This time is confusing!)
   ```

## Example Usage

1. Start the application.
2. Input a valid time, such as `14` for hours and `21` for minutes.
3. The application will process and output the next confusing time.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter an invalid time, the application will prompt you to try again until a valid time is provided.
- **No Confusing Time Found**: If the application does not find a confusing time within a day, it will inform you accordingly.

## Conclusion

The Confusing Time Finder is a fun and simple application that explores the concept of confusing times in a 24-hour format. Enjoy finding your next confusing time!
