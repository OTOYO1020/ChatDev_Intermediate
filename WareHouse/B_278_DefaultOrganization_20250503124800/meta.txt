Task:
Read the current time values H (hours) and M (minutes) from standard input. Define a function 'is_confusing_time(h, m)' that checks if the time is confusing:\n   - Extract digits A, B, C, D from h and m.\n   - Swap the top-right (C) and bottom-left (B) digits.\n   - Form a new time using the swapped digits and check if it is a valid time in the 24-hour system. Initialize a loop to find the next confusing time starting from the current time (H, M). In each iteration of the loop:\n   - Call 'is_confusing_time(H, M)' to check if the current time is confusing.\n   - If it is, break the loop and store the result.\n   - If it is not, increment the time by one minute:\n     - If M reaches 60, reset M to 0 and increment H by 1.\n     - If H reaches 24, reset H to 0. Print the next confusing time in the format 'H:M', ensuring proper formatting for single-digit hours and minutes.
