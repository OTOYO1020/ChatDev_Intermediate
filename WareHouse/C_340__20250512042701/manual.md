# Total Payment Calculator

A simple application to calculate the total payment based on an integer input using a unique algorithm.

## Main Functions

The Total Payment Calculator provides the following main functionalities:

- **Calculate Total Payment**: Given an integer `N`, the application calculates the total payment by repeatedly splitting integers on a blackboard until all integers are less than 2. The total payment is the sum of all integers processed during this operation.

## Quick Install

To run the Total Payment Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Total Payment Calculator is designed to help users understand how a specific algorithm works for calculating payments based on integer operations. The application uses a queue-like structure to manage integers and processes them according to the defined rules.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input an Integer**: When prompted, enter an integer value for `N`. The application will calculate the total payment based on the provided integer.

4. **View the Result**: After processing, the application will display the total payment calculated.

## Example Usage

- **Input**: If you enter `10`, the application will process the integer and display the total payment based on the defined algorithm.

## Error Handling

If you enter a non-integer value, the application will prompt you to enter a valid integer. Please ensure that your input is an integer to avoid errors.

## Conclusion

The Total Payment Calculator is a straightforward tool for understanding integer processing and payment calculation. Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your needs!
