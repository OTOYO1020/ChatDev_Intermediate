Define a function 'calculate_total_payment(N: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for calculating the total payment. Initialize a variable 'total_payment' to 0 to keep track of the total amount paid by Takahashi. Use a data structure (like a list or a queue) to represent the integers on the blackboard, starting with the integer 'N'. Implement a loop that continues until there are no integers not less than 2 on the blackboard. Within the loop, select an integer 'x' from the blackboard that is not less than 2. Add the value of 'x' to 'total_payment' to account for the cost of the operation. Calculate 'floor_x = x // 2' and 'ceil_x = (x + 1) // 2' to determine the new integers to be added to the blackboard. Remove one occurrence of 'x' from the blackboard and add 'floor_x' and 'ceil_x' to the blackboard. Ensure the loop continues until all integers on the blackboard are less than 2. Return the value of 'total_payment' as the output of the function.
