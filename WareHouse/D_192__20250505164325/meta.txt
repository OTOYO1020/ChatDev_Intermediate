Task:
Read the string \( X \) and the integer \( M \) from standard input. Determine the greatest digit \( d \) in the string \( X \) by iterating through each character in \( X \) and converting it to an integer. Initialize a counter \( count \) to zero to keep track of valid integers. Loop through possible base values \( n \) starting from \( d + 1 \) up to \( M \):\n   - For each base \( n \), convert the string \( X \) into an integer using base \( n \).\n   - Check if the converted integer is less than or equal to \( M \).\n   - If valid, increment the \( count \) by 1. After the loop, print the final value of \( count \) as the result.
