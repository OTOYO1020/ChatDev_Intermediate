Here's a detailed user manual for the base counting application, formatted in Markdown as requested:

# Base Counting Application

A Python application to count valid bases for a given string representation of a number.

## Overview

This application reads a string \( X \) and an integer \( M \) from the user. It determines the greatest digit \( d \) in the string \( X \) and counts how many bases from \( d + 1 \) to \( M \) can represent the string \( X \) as an integer that is less than or equal to \( M \).

## Main Functions

1. **get_greatest_digit(x)**: 
   - Returns the greatest digit found in the string \( x \).
   
2. **count_valid_bases(x, greatest_digit, m)**: 
   - Counts the valid bases from \( greatest\_digit + 1 \) to \( m \) and returns the count of valid bases.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: 
   Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Requirements**: 
   - When prompted, enter a string \( X \) that contains digits (e.g., "123").
   - Enter an integer \( M \) that specifies the upper limit for the valid bases.

4. **Output**: 
   The application will output the count of valid bases that can represent the string \( X \) as an integer less than or equal to \( M \).

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter a string (X): 123
Enter an integer (M): 10
Valid bases count: 1
```

In this example, the application checks the bases starting from the greatest digit in "123" (which is 3) up to 10, and finds that only base 4 can represent "123" as an integer less than or equal to 10.

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-integer value for \( M \), the application will prompt you to enter a valid integer.
- If the string \( X \) contains non-digit characters, the application will notify you and exit early.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to determine valid bases for a given string representation of a number. For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
