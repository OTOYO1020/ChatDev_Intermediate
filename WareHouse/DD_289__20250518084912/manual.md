# Robot Step Checker

A simple application to determine if a robot can reach a specified step while avoiding traps.

## Main Functions

The Robot Step Checker provides the following main functionalities:

- **Determine Reachability**: The core function `canReachStep(X: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> bool` checks if the robot can reach the X-th step given a list of step sizes and trap steps.
- **Input Handling**: The application reads input values for the target step, step sizes, and trap steps from standard input.
- **Output Results**: The application outputs 'YES' if the robot can reach the target step, otherwise it outputs 'NO'.

## Installation

To run the Robot Step Checker, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install collections
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Input

The application expects input in the following format:

1. The first line contains the integer `X`, the target step.
2. The second line contains a comma-separated list of integers representing the step sizes `A`.
3. The third line contains a comma-separated list of integers representing the trap steps `B`.

**Example Input:**
```
5
1,2,3
3,4
```

### Step 2: Run the Application

You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. Make sure to provide the input through standard input. You can do this by redirecting a file or using a pipe.

**Example Command:**
```bash
python main.py < input.txt
```

Where `input.txt` contains the input data as described above.

### Step 3: Interpret Output

The application will output either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the robot can reach the specified step without hitting any traps.

## Edge Cases

- If `X` is 0, the output will be 'YES' since the robot is already at the starting step.
- If the list of step sizes `A` is empty, the output will be 'NO'.
- If any step size or trap step is negative, the output will be 'NO'.

## Conclusion

The Robot Step Checker is a straightforward tool for determining the reachability of a target step in a step-based environment while avoiding traps. Follow the installation and usage instructions to get started!
