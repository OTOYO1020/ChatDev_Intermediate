Task:
Define the function 'canReachStep(X: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> bool' to determine if the robot can reach the X-th step. Parse the input to extract the values of X, the list A of step sizes, and the list B of trap steps. Initialize a set to keep track of visited steps to avoid cycles. Use a queue to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the 0-th step. For each step the robot can reach, check if it is a trap by referencing the list B. If the robot reaches the X-th step during the BFS, return True. If the BFS completes without reaching the X-th step, return False. Ensure to handle edge cases where X is 0 or if there are no steps in A. Implement input validation to ensure all constraints are met before processing. Output the result as 'YES' if the robot can reach the X-th step, otherwise output 'NO'.
