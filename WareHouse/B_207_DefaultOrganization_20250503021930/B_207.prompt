Read integers A, B, C, and D from standard input. Initialize a variable 'operations' to 0 to count the number of operations performed. Check if the initial condition is already satisfied (A ≤ D * 0). If so, print 'operations' and return. While the condition (A > D * R) is not satisfied:\n   - Calculate the minimum number of red balls needed, 'R', such that A ≤ D * R.\n   - Increment 'operations' by 1.\n   - Update the number of cyan balls: A = A + B.\n   - Update the number of red balls: R = R + C. After exiting the loop, print the total number of 'operations'.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that we systematically check the conditions and update the counts of balls while keeping track of the operations needed to achieve the goal.
