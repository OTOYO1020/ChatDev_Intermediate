# Ball Operations Application

A simple application to calculate the number of operations needed to satisfy a condition involving red and cyan balls.

## Main Functions

The Ball Operations application performs the following key functions:

1. **Input Reading**: Reads four integers A, B, C, and D from standard input.
2. **Initial Condition Check**: Checks if the initial condition (A ≤ D * 0) is satisfied.
3. **Operation Calculation**: Calculates the minimum number of red balls needed and updates the counts of cyan and red balls while counting the operations performed.
4. **Output**: Prints the total number of operations required to satisfy the condition.

## Installation

To run the Ball Operations application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: The application uses the `math` module, which is included in the Python standard library. No additional packages are required.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the integer values for A, B, C, and D. For example:

   ```
   Enter A: 10
   Enter B: 2
   Enter C: 1
   Enter D: 3
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the total number of operations required to satisfy the condition.

   ```
   Total operations: X
   ```

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application.
2. Input the following values when prompted:

   ```
   Enter A: 10
   Enter B: 5
   Enter C: 2
   Enter D: 4
   ```

3. The application will output the total operations needed to satisfy the condition.

## Error Handling

- If the input value for A is less than or equal to D * 0, the application will notify you that the input is invalid.
- If D is zero, the application will also indicate an invalid input to avoid division by zero errors.

## Conclusion

The Ball Operations application is a straightforward tool for calculating operations based on specified conditions involving red and cyan balls. Follow the instructions above to install and run the application effectively.
