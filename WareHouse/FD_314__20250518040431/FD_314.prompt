Define the function 'calculate_expected_wins(N: int, matches: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters, where 'N' is the number of players and 'matches' is a list of tuples representing the matches between players. Parse the input to extract the number of players 'N' and the list of matches 'matches' from the input format. Initialize a list 'expected_wins' of size 'N' with zeros to store the expected number of wins for each player. For each match 'i' from 1 to 'N-1', retrieve players 'p_i' and 'q_i' from the 'matches' list. Calculate the sizes of the teams for players 'p_i' and 'q_i' and determine the winning probabilities for each team using the formulas 'prob_first = a / (a + b)' and 'prob_second = b / (a + b)'. Update the expected wins for players 'p_i' and 'q_i' in the 'expected_wins' list based on the calculated probabilities. Combine the teams of players 'p_i' and 'q_i' into a single team after each match, updating the team sizes accordingly. After processing all matches, compute the expected values as irreducible fractions for each player in 'expected_wins'. Convert the expected values into the required format 'z' using the modulo operation with '998244353'. Return the list of results 'z' for each player as the output of the function.
