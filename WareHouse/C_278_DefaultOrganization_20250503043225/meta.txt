Task:
Read integers N and Q from standard input, where N is the number of users and Q is the number of operations. Initialize a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or a set) to keep track of the following relationships between users. Loop through Q operations, reading each operation represented by integers T_i, A_i, and B_i. For each operation:\n   - If T_i = 1 (follow operation):\n     - Add user A_i to the following list of user B_i if not already present.\n   - If T_i = 2 (unfollow operation):\n     - Remove user A_i from the following list of user B_i if present.\n   - If T_i = 3 (check following status):\n     - Check if user A_i is following user B_i and if user B_i is following user A_i.\n     - Store the result (Yes or No) for this operation. After processing all operations, collect results for all T_i = 3 operations in the order they were encountered. Print the results for T_i = 3 operations, each on a new line.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Use 'def process_operations(N, Q, operations)' to encapsulate the logic.\n- Use a dictionary 'following' to track the relationships.\n- Store results in a list 'results' for T_i = 3 operations.\n\n### Input Format:\n- The input will be read from standard input in the format:\n  '''\n  N Q\n  T_1 A_1 B_1\n  T_2 A_2 B_2 T_Q A_Q B_Q\n  '''\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output will consist of lines with Yes or No for each T_i = 3 operation, printed in the order they were requested.
