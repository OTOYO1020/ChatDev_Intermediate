Task:
Read the dimensions of the grid, H and W, from standard input. Initialize a 2D list 'grid' to store the characters representing each square in the grid. Populate the 'grid' with characters from standard input, ensuring to identify the positions of 'S' and 'G'. Initialize a queue for breadth-first search (BFS) and a set to keep track of visited squares. Enqueue the starting position of 'S' into the BFS queue. While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n   - Dequeue the current position and check if it is 'G'. If yes, print the time taken to reach 'G' and exit.\n   - For each possible move (up, down, left, right), check if the move is valid (i.e., not out of bounds and not a '#').\n   - If the move is valid and not visited, enqueue the new position and mark it as visited.\n   - If the current position is a teleporter (a-z), enqueue all other positions with the same character that have not been visited. If the queue is exhausted and 'G' has not been reached, print '-1' to indicate that the destination is unreachable. Ensure to handle the BFS traversal efficiently to accommodate the maximum grid size of 2000x2000. Implement the BFS logic in a function 'find_shortest_time(S, G, grid)' that takes the start and goal positions along with the grid as arguments. Print the final result based on the output of the 'find_shortest_time' function.
