# Medicine Pill Calculator

A simple application to calculate the total number of pills taken based on prescribed medicines over a specified number of days.

## Main Functions

The Medicine Pill Calculator allows users to:

1. **Input the Number of Medicines**: Specify how many different types of medicines are prescribed.
2. **Input Medicine Details**: For each medicine, input the number of days it is prescribed and the number of pills taken each day.
3. **Set Maximum Pills**: Define a maximum limit for the total number of pills that can be taken on any given day.
4. **Calculate Valid Days**: The application will calculate and display the first day where the total number of pills taken is less than or equal to the specified maximum.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Medicine Pill Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Medicines**: When prompted, enter the number of different kinds of medicine prescribed. Ensure you enter a positive integer.

3. **Input Medicine Details**: For each medicine, you will be prompted to enter the number of days and the number of pills taken each day. Input these values as space-separated integers.

4. **Set Maximum Pills (K)**: After entering all medicine details, you will be asked to enter the maximum number of pills (K). Enter a non-negative integer.

5. **View Results**: The application will process the input and display the first valid day where the total pills taken is less than or equal to K. If no such day exists, a message will indicate that.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of different kinds of medicine prescribed: 2
Enter days and pills for medicine 1 (space-separated): 5 2
Enter days and pills for medicine 2 (space-separated): 3 3
Enter the maximum number of pills (K): 5
Valid day found: 1 with total pills = 5 (<= 5)
```

## Future Enhancements

The application is designed to be extensible. Future enhancements may include:

- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Exporting results to Excel or other formats.
- Implementing additional validation and error handling features.
