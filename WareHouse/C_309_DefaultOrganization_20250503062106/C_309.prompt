Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of different kinds of medicine prescribed. Initialize an array 'medicines' to store tuples of (a_i, b_i) for each type of medicine, where a_i is the number of days and b_i is the number of pills taken each day. For each medicine type (from 1 to N), read the values of a_i and b_i from standard input and store them in the 'medicines' array. Initialize a variable 'total_pills' to 0 to keep track of the total number of pills taken on each day. Loop through each day from 1 to the maximum a_i in the 'medicines' array:\n   - For each medicine type, check if the current day is within the range of a_i days.\n   - If it is, add b_i to 'total_pills'.\n   - After updating 'total_pills', check if 'total_pills' is less than or equal to K.\n   - If it is, store the current day as the result and break the loop. If a day is found where the total pills are K or less, print that day; otherwise, print a message indicating that no such day exists.
