# Max Product Calculator

A Python application designed to compute the maximum product of the largest K integers from a given list of integers.

## Quick Install

To install the necessary dependencies for the Max Product Calculator, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you anticipate future enhancements that may require additional libraries, you can uncomment the lines for `numpy` and `pandas` in the `requirements.txt` file.

## ü§î What is this?

The Max Product Calculator is a utility that allows users to determine the maximum product of a specified number of integers from a list. It handles various edge cases, including:

- Sorting the list to easily select the largest integers.
- Calculating the product modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.
- Managing negative numbers and ensuring the product is calculated correctly based on the count of negative integers selected.

## üìñ Main Functions

### 1. `max_product(N: int, K: int, A: List[int]) -> int`

- **Parameters**:
  - `N`: The number of integers in the list.
  - `K`: The number of integers to choose for the product calculation.
  - `A`: A list of integers from which to select the largest K integers.

- **Returns**: The maximum product of the largest K integers modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### 2. Input Handling

The application reads input directly from the user. The expected input format is as follows:

- First, enter the integer `N` (the number of integers).
- Next, enter the integer `K` (the number of integers to choose).
- Finally, enter the list of integers `A` as space-separated values.

### Example Input

```
Enter N: 5
Enter K: 3
Enter List A (space-separated): 1 -2 3 4 -5
```

### Example Output

```
Max Product: 12
```

## üõ† How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and `product_calculator.py`.
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
4. Install the required dependencies using the command mentioned above.
5. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

6. Follow the prompts to input the values for `N`, `K`, and the list `A`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Ensure that the length of the list `A` matches the value of `N`. If not, a `ValueError` will be raised.
- The application handles edge cases, including scenarios where:
  - K is equal to N.
  - There are no positive numbers available when K is odd.
  - The product is calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow.
