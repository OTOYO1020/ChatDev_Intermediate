Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of departments. Initialize an array 'K' of size N to store the number of people in each department. Read N integers from standard input and populate the array 'K' with values representing the number of people in each department. Define a function 'min_max_lunch_break(K)' that takes the array 'K' as an argument. In 'min_max_lunch_break', generate all possible ways to divide the departments into two groups (Group A and Group B). For each division, calculate the total number of people in Group A and Group B. Determine the maximum number of people taking a lunch break at the same time for that division. Track the minimum value of the maximum lunch break counts across all divisions. Return the minimum value found. Print the result from 'min_max_lunch_break(K)' as the final output.
