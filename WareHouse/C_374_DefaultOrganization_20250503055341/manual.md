# Lunch Break Application

A Python application designed to calculate the minimum maximum lunch break counts across departments.

## Overview

The Lunch Break application allows users to input the number of departments and the number of people in each department. It then calculates the optimal way to divide these departments into two groups to minimize the maximum number of people taking a lunch break at the same time.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of departments and the corresponding number of people in each department from standard input.
- **Division Calculation**: The core function `min_max_lunch_break(K)` generates all possible ways to divide the departments into two groups and calculates the maximum number of people taking a lunch break simultaneously for each division.
- **Output**: The application outputs the minimum value of the maximum lunch break counts across all divisions.

## Installation

To run the Lunch Break application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. You can run it directly without additional installations.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the number of departments (a positive integer). Then, enter the number of people in each department as a comma-separated list of non-negative integers. For example:
   ```
   Enter number of departments (positive integer): 3
   Enter number of people in each department (comma-separated non-negative integers): 10, 20, 30
   ```

3. **View Results**: After inputting the data, the application will calculate and display the minimum maximum lunch break:
   ```
   Minimum maximum lunch break: 30
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the number of departments:
   ```
   Enter number of departments (positive integer): 4
   ```

3. Input the number of people in each department:
   ```
   Enter number of people in each department (comma-separated non-negative integers): 5, 15, 10, 20
   ```

4. The output will display:
   ```
   Minimum maximum lunch break: 20
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Input Errors**: Ensure that the number of departments matches the number of people provided. All inputs must be non-negative integers.
- **Unexpected Errors**: If you encounter unexpected errors, check your Python installation and ensure that you are using Python 3.x.
