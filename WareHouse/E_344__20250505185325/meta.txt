Task:
Read the integer values N (length of sequence A) and Q (number of queries) from standard input. Read the sequence A of length N from standard input and store it in a list. Initialize an empty list to store the queries. For each query from 1 to Q:\n   - Read the query type and associated values (x, y for type 1; x for type 2).\n   - Store the query in the list for processing. Process each query in the order they were received:\n   - If the query type is '1 x y':\n     - Find the index of element x in A.\n     - Insert y immediately after x in A.\n   - If the query type is '2 x':\n     - Remove the element x from A. Ensure that after each query, the list A remains non-empty and contains distinct elements. Print the final state of list A after processing all queries.
