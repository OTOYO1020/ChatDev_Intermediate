Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of bounces (excluding the initial bounce at coordinate 0). Initialize a list 'L' to store the lengths of the bounces, and read N integers from standard input to populate this list. Initialize a variable 'D' to keep track of the current coordinate, starting with 'D = 0' for the first bounce. Initialize a counter 'bounce_count' to zero to count the number of bounces at coordinates less than or equal to X. For each bounce from 1 to N (inclusive):\n   - Update the coordinate 'D' by adding the length of the previous bounce: 'D += L[i-1]'.\n   - If 'D' is less than or equal to X, increment 'bounce_count'. After processing all bounces, print the value of 'bounce_count' as the result.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that we handle the input correctly, maintain the necessary calculations, and produce the desired output in a structured manner.
