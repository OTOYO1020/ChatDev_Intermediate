# Bounce Counting Application

A simple application to calculate the number of bounces based on given lengths and a specified coordinate.

## Main Functions

The Bounce Counting application allows users to:

- Input the number of bounces (N).
- Enter the lengths of each bounce.
- Specify a coordinate (X).
- Calculate and display the number of bounces that occur at coordinates less than or equal to X.

## Quick Install

To run the Bounce Counting application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Dependencies

The application does not require any external libraries, but you must have Python 3.x installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, follow the instructions on the official website to install it.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   If the application is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and run the application using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of bounces (N). This should be a non-negative integer.
   - If N is greater than 0, enter the lengths of the bounces as space-separated integers.
   - Finally, enter the coordinate (X) to check against the bounces.

4. **View Results**:
   After entering the required data, the application will calculate and display the number of bounces that occur at coordinates less than or equal to X.

## Example Usage

```
Enter number of bounces (N): 3
Enter lengths of bounces (space-separated): 2 3 5
Enter coordinate X: 6
Number of bounces <= 6: 2
```

In this example, the application calculates that there are 2 bounces (the first and second) that occur at coordinates less than or equal to 6.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- If N is a negative integer, an error message will be displayed.
- If the number of lengths provided does not match N, an error message will be displayed.
- If any other input error occurs, a general input error message will be shown.

## Conclusion

The Bounce Counting application is a straightforward tool for calculating bounces based on user input. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear feedback for incorrect inputs. For further assistance or feature requests, please contact the development team.
