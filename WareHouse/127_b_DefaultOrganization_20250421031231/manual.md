# Algae Growth Simulation

The Algae Growth Simulation software allows users to model the growth of algae over a period of 10 years based on specified parameters. This simulation can be useful for ecological studies, environmental monitoring, and educational purposes.

## Main Functions

- **Input Reception**: The software prompts the user to input three integers:
  - `r`: Growth coefficient (non-negative integer)
  - `D`: Amount of attrition (non-negative integer)
  - `x_2000`: Weight of algae in the year 2000 (non-negative integer)

- **Growth Simulation**: The software calculates the weight of algae for each year from 2001 to 2010 using the formula:
  - \( x_{i+1} = r \cdot x_i - D \)
  
- **Output**: The results are displayed as integers, showing the weight of algae for each year from 2001 to 2010.

## Installation

To run the Algae Growth Simulation software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv algae_env
   source algae_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `algae_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Create a `requirements.txt` file and include any necessary libraries. For this project, there are no external dependencies required at the moment, but you can add placeholders for future use:
   ```plaintext
   # requirements.txt
   # Add any future dependencies here
   ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**: If you have any libraries listed in `requirements.txt`, install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**: When prompted, enter the values for the growth coefficient (`r`), attrition amount (`D`), and the weight of algae in the year 2000 (`x_2000`). Ensure that all values are non-negative integers.

3. **View Results**: After entering the parameters, the software will simulate the algae growth for 10 years and display the results one year at a time.

4. **Handle Warnings**: If the algae weight drops below zero at any point during the simulation, a warning will be displayed, and the simulation will stop.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Please enter a non-negative integer for the growth coefficient (r): 3
Please enter a non-negative integer for the attrition amount (D): 5
Please enter a non-negative integer for the weight of algae in 2000 (x_2000): 10
Algae weight from 2001 to 2010:
25
70
185
490
1305
3430
9005
23670
62385
164130
```

## Conclusion

The Algae Growth Simulation software provides a simple yet effective way to model algae growth based on user-defined parameters. For any questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
