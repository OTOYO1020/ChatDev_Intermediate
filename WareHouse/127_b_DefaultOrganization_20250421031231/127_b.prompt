Input reception and initialization: Read three integers r, D, and x_2000 from standard input and store them in the respective variables. These represent the growth coefficient, the amount of attrition, and the weight of the algae in the year 2000.Preparation for growth simulation: Initialize the variable x for simulating algae growth with x_2000. Prepare a list results to store the growth results. Execution of growth simulation: Calculate the weight of the algae every year for 10 years from 2001 to 2010 using the following formula: x_{i+1} = r * x_i - D. Store the calculated values in results in order and update the variable x. Output processing: Output the values obtained from the simulation from x_2001 to x_2010 one line at a time across 10 lines. Make sure to display the output as integers.
