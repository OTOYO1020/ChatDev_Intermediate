# Sequence Counter

A Python application for counting valid sequences based on given constraints.

## Overview

The Sequence Counter application defines a function `count_sequences(N: int, C: List[int]) -> int` that calculates the number of valid sequences based on the constraints provided in the list `C`. The application ensures that all integers in the resulting sequences are distinct and adheres to the specified limits.

## Main Functions

- **count_sequences(N, C)**: This function takes an integer `N` and a list of integers `C`, and returns the total number of valid sequences modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Input Validation**: The application validates that the length of list `C` matches `N` and that all values in `C` are positive integers.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling for invalid inputs and unexpected errors.

## Installation

To run the Sequence Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   The application requires no additional dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Input Format**:
   - When prompted, enter an integer `N` (the number of elements in the list).
   - Then, enter the list `C` as a comma-separated string of integers.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter N: 3
   Enter C (comma-separated): 2,3,4
   ```

2. **Output**:
   - The application will output the total number of valid sequences based on the provided constraints.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Number of valid sequences: 12
   ```

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the input does not meet the constraints (e.g., `N` does not match the length of `C` or contains non-positive integers), the application will display an error message.

   Example Error:
   ```
   Input Error: Invalid input. Please ensure N matches the length of C and all values are positive integers.
   ```

## Conclusion

The Sequence Counter application is a straightforward tool for counting valid sequences based on user-defined constraints. It is designed to be user-friendly and includes robust error handling to guide users in providing valid input.
