Task:
Define the function 'min_banknotes(N: int) -> int' that takes an integer N as input, representing the value of the takoyaki machine. Implement a method to calculate the minimum number of banknotes needed to pay at least N using the available banknote denominations. Create a list of banknote values as powers of 10, ranging from 10^0 to 10^(10^100), to represent the available denominations. Determine the minimum number of banknotes required for the payment amount, which is the smallest power of 10 that is greater than or equal to N. Calculate the change that the clerk will give back, which is the payment amount minus N. Determine the minimum number of banknotes required for the change using the same banknote denominations. Sum the total number of banknotes used by both the customer and the clerk. Ensure that the function handles edge cases where N is at its minimum and maximum values. Test the function with various values of N to verify correctness and performance. Return the total minimum number of banknotes used as the output of the function.
