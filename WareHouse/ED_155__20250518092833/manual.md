# Takoyaki Machine Payment System

A simple application to calculate the minimum number of banknotes needed to pay for a Takoyaki machine using available banknote denominations.

## Main Functions

- **Calculate Minimum Banknotes**: The application calculates the minimum number of banknotes required to pay at least a specified amount (N) using banknotes that are powers of 10 (from 10^0 to 10^100).
- **Handle Change Calculation**: It also computes the change to be returned and determines the minimum number of banknotes needed for that change.

## Installation

To run the Takoyaki machine payment system, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. **Input Amount**: 
   When prompted, enter the amount (N) you wish to pay for the Takoyaki machine. Ensure that the amount is a positive integer (at least 1).

3. **View Results**: 
   The application will calculate and display the total number of banknotes used for the payment and any change that needs to be returned.

### Example Usage
