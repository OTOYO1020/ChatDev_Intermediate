# Score Calculator

A software tool designed to calculate the minimum number of additional problems players need to solve in order to exceed the scores of their competitors in a competitive programming environment.

## Main Functions

The Score Calculator provides the following functionalities:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads the number of players (N) and the number of problems (M) from standard input.
2. **Score Validation**: Ensures that the scores of the problems are multiples of 100 and fall within the range of 500 to 2500.
3. **Score Calculation**: Computes the total score for each player based on the problems they have solved and adds a bonus based on their player index.
4. **Additional Problems Calculation**: Determines the number of additional problems each player needs to solve to exceed the maximum score of other players.
5. **Output**: Displays the results, indicating how many additional problems each player must solve.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Score Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Note: If you do not have a `requirements.txt` file, the current implementation does not require any additional libraries beyond Python's standard library.)

## How to Use the Score Calculator

1. **Prepare Input**: The program expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain two integers, N (number of players) and M (number of problems).
   - The second line should contain M integers representing the scores of the problems.
   - The next N lines should contain strings of length M, where each character is either 'o' (indicating the problem was solved) or 'x' (indicating the problem was not solved).

   Example Input:
   ```
   3 5
   500 600 700 800 900
   ooxxo
   xooox
   ooxxo
   ```

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the `main.py` script in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the input, the program will output the minimum number of additional problems each player needs to solve to exceed the scores of all other players, each on a new line.

   Example Output:
   ```
   1
   2
   0
   ```

## Conclusion

The Score Calculator is a powerful tool for competitive programming environments, allowing players to assess their performance and strategize on how to improve their scores. For any issues or further assistance, please contact our support team.
