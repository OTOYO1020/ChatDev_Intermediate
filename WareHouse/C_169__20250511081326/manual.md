## ðŸ¤” What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a classic board game where two players take turns placing their markers (X and O) on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to get five of their markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## ðŸ“– Main Functions

### Game Components

- **Board**: The game board is represented as a 15x15 grid where players can place their markers.
- **Cell**: Each cell on the board can either be empty or occupied by a player's marker (X or O).

### Game Flow

1. **Start the Game**: The game starts automatically when you run the `main.py` file.
2. **Display the Board**: The current state of the board is displayed after each turn.
3. **Player Turns**: Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (0 to 14).
4. **Check for Winner**: After each move, the game checks if there is a winner or if the game is a draw.
5. **Play Again**: At the end of the game, players are prompted to play again or exit.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. **Run the Game**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the game files are located.
   - Run the game using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Make Your Move**:
   - When prompted, enter your move in the format `row column` (e.g., `7 7` for the center of the board).
   - Ensure that your input is two integers separated by a space.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to align five of their markers in a row wins the game.
   - If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
