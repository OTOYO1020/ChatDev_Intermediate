# Hand Movement Operations

A Python application for calculating the total number of operations required to move hands on a circular ring based on user instructions.

## Quick Install

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Currently, there are no additional dependencies required beyond Python's standard library.*

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This application allows users to simulate the movement of two hands on a circular ring of size N. Users can provide a series of instructions to move either the left or right hand to specified target positions, and the application will calculate the total number of operations required to execute these movements.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application reads integers N (size of the ring) and Q (number of instructions) from standard input, followed by Q pairs of instructions.
   
2. **Hand Movement Logic**: 
   - The left hand starts at position 1, and the right hand starts at position 2 (or 1 if N is 1).
   - For each instruction, the application calculates the minimum number of operations required to move the specified hand to the target position while keeping the other hand stationary.

3. **Operation Calculation**: The application uses a helper function to compute the minimum operations needed to move between positions on the circular ring, accounting for both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements.

4. **Output**: After processing all instructions, the application prints the total number of operations performed.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Provide Input**: Enter the values for N and Q, followed by Q pairs of instructions in the format `H_i T_i`, where:
   - `H_i` is either 'L' (for left hand) or 'R' (for right hand).
   - `T_i` is the target position (an integer between 1 and N).

   Example Input:
   ```
   5 3
   L 3
   R 4
   L 1
   ```

3. **View Output**: After entering the instructions, the application will output the total number of operations required to execute all movements.

## Example

For a ring of size 5 and the following instructions:

```
5 3
L 3
R 4
L 1
```

The application will calculate the operations needed to move the left hand to position 3, the right hand to position 4, and then the left hand back to position 1, and print the total operations.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to simulate hand movements on a circular ring, making it useful for various applications that require such calculations. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our development team.
