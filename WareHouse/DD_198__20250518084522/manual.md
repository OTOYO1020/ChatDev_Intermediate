# Alphametic Solver

A Python application for solving alphametic puzzles, where letters are replaced by digits to create valid arithmetic equations.

## Overview

The Alphametic Solver allows users to input three strings representing an equation in the form of letters. The goal is to find a unique digit for each letter such that the equation holds true. For example, in the equation `SEND + MORE = MONEY`, each letter represents a unique digit.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads three strings from standard input.
- **Validation**: It checks if the lengths of the input strings are the same and ensures that there are no more than 10 unique characters.
- **Digit Mapping**: The application generates all possible combinations of digit assignments for the unique characters.
- **Equation Checking**: It checks if the equation formed by the input strings holds true for any valid digit assignment.
- **Output**: If a solution exists, it outputs the corresponding integers; otherwise, it indicates that no solution was found.

## Installation

To run the Alphametic Solver, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/alphametic-solver.git
   cd alphametic-solver
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   You can install the required dependencies using pip. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can run the application without any additional dependencies as it only uses standard libraries.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Strings**:
   When prompted, enter the three strings (S1, S2, S3) that represent the alphametic equation. For example:
   ```
   Enter first string (S1): SEND
   Enter second string (S2): MORE
   Enter third string (S3): MONEY
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   After entering the strings, the application will process the input and display the result. If a solution exists, it will output:
   ```
   Solution: 9567 1085 10652
   ```
   If no solution is found, it will display:
   ```
   No solution
   ```

## Example

To illustrate how the application works, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  Enter first string (S1): LEET
  Enter second string (S2): CODE
  Enter third string (S3): COOL
  ```

- Output:
  ```
  Solution: 1337 0423 1750
  ```

## Conclusion

The Alphametic Solver is a powerful tool for enthusiasts of puzzles and programming alike. It demonstrates the use of combinatorial logic and character mapping in Python. Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance its functionality or adapt it for other purposes.
