Define the function 'assign_playing_fields(N: int, M: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]' to handle the assignment of integers to playing fields. Initialize a list 'assignments' to store the pairs of integers assigned to each playing field. Create a loop to iterate over the range of 'M' playing fields, and for each field, assign two distinct integers from the range '1' to 'N'. Ensure that the assigned integers for each playing field are distinct and do not repeat across different fields. Implement the logic to increment each player's integer after each round, wrapping around to '1' if the integer exceeds 'N'. Maintain a record of which players have already fought each other to ensure no player fights the same opponent more than once. Check the constraints to ensure that 'M * 2 + 1 <= N' is satisfied before proceeding with the assignments. Return the 'assignments' list containing the pairs of integers assigned to each playing field. Format the output of the function to match the required output format, ensuring each pair is printed on a new line. Test the function with various values of 'N' and 'M' to ensure correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.
