# Subarray Sum Calculator

A Python application designed to compute the total sum of all subarray sums modulo a given integer. This tool is useful for analyzing sequences of non-negative integers and can be integrated into larger data processing workflows.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer N (number of elements) and a positive integer M (modulo value) from standard input, along with a sequence of N non-negative integers.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the inputs are valid, checking that N and M are positive and that the length of the sequence matches N.
- **Subarray Sum Calculation**: Iterates through all possible pairs of indices to compute the sum of subarrays and calculates the modulo with M.
- **Output**: Displays the final cumulative result of the modulo sums.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the integer N (the number of elements in the sequence).
   - Enter the positive integer M (the modulo value).
   - Input the sequence of non-negative integers separated by spaces.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter N (number of elements, must be positive): 3
   Enter M (positive modulo value): 5
   Enter the sequence of non-negative integers (space-separated): 1 2 3
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   After processing the input, the application will output the total sum of all subarray sums modulo M.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Total Sum: 12
   ```

## Future Enhancements

This application is designed with potential future enhancements in mind. Libraries like NumPy or Pandas can be integrated for more advanced data manipulation and analysis. If you wish to prepare for these enhancements, consider adding the following to your `requirements.txt`:
```
numpy
