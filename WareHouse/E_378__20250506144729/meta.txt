Task:
Read the integer N and the positive integer M from standard input. Read the sequence of N non-negative integers A from standard input. Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to 0 to store the cumulative result. Iterate over all possible pairs (l, r) where 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N:\n   - For each pair, compute the sum of the subarray A[l] to A[r]. Calculate the modulo of the computed sum with M: 'mod_value = (sum_value % M)'. Add 'mod_value' to 'total_sum'. After processing all pairs, print the final value of 'total_sum'.
