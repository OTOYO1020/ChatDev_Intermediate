Define the function 'find_second_place(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to encapsulate the tournament logic. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the list of ratings A, ensuring that N is within the range 1 to 16 and the ratings are unique integers between 1 and 10^9. Initialize a list of players with their labels based on the input ratings, where each player is represented as a tuple of (label, rating). Implement the tournament structure as a loop that iterates from i = 1 to N, simulating matches between players based on their labels and ratings. For each round, identify the players who have not lost and sort them by their labels to determine the matchups. Conduct matches between pairs of players, updating the list of players to only include winners after each round. Keep track of the final match participants and determine the player who loses in the final match, which will be the second place. Return the label of the player who finishes in second place from the function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as the minimum and maximum values of N and ratings. Format the output to display the label of the second place player as an integer.
