Define the function 'find_eaten_cookie(H: int, W: int, grid: List[List[str]]) -> Tuple[int, int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the values of H and W, and the grid state represented by 'S_{i,j}'. Initialize a variable to track the rectangle boundaries (a, b, c, d) where cookies are present. Iterate through the grid to identify the top-left corner (a, c) of the rectangle containing cookies. Continue iterating to find the bottom-right corner (b, d) of the rectangle containing cookies. Ensure that the identified rectangle dimensions are valid (at least 2 squares long in both height and width). Count the total number of cookies in the identified rectangle. Iterate through the rectangle to find the position of the missing cookie by comparing the total count with the expected count. Return the coordinates of the missing cookie as a tuple (i, j). Output the result in the format (i, j) where i is the row and j is the column of the eaten cookie.
