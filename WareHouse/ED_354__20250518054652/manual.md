# Card Game Application

Welcome to the Card Game Application! This software allows you to play a strategic card game where two players, Takahashi and Aoki, take turns removing pairs of cards based on their front and back values. The game continues until no valid moves are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

## Main Functions

- **Determine Winner**: The core functionality of the application is to determine the winner of the card game based on optimal play.
- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of cards and their respective front and back values from the user.
- **Game Logic**: The game logic encapsulates the rules for removing pairs of cards and switching turns between players.

## Installation

To run the Card Game Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install any required dependencies using pip. If there are specific dependencies, they should be listed in a `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use/Play

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the game.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Cards**: When prompted, enter the number of cards (N) you wish to play with. Ensure that N meets the constraints of the game (e.g., a positive integer).

3. **Input Front Values**: Enter the front values of the cards as space-separated integers. For example:
   ```
   1 2 3 4
   ```

4. **Input Back Values**: Enter the back values of the cards as space-separated integers. For example:
   ```
   4 3 2 1
   ```

5. **View the Winner**: After entering the values, the application will simulate the game and print the winner's name (either "Takahashi" or "Aoki") based on the optimal play.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to play the game:

```
Enter the number of cards: 4
Enter the front values of the cards (space-separated): 1 2 3 4
Enter the back values of the cards (space-separated): 4 3 2 1
The winner is: Takahashi
```

## Edge Cases

- If no pairs can be formed initially, the game will end immediately, and the player who cannot make a move will lose.
- Ensure that the input values are integers and that the number of front and back values matches the number of cards.
