# Color Application

A simple application to determine the minimum number of colors required to paint a list of integers based on specific conditions.

## Main Functions

The Color Application provides a single primary function:

- **min_colors_required(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int**: 
  - This function calculates the minimum number of colors required to paint the integers in the list `A` such that no two equal integers share the same color. The function sorts the list and assigns colors based on the unique integers present.

## Quick Install

To run the Color Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Prepare your input**: The input should consist of an integer `N` followed by `N` integers. For example:
   ```
   5 1 2 2 3 1
   ```
   Here, `5` is the number of integers, and `1, 2, 2, 3, 1` are the integers in the list.

2. **Run the application**: You can run the application from the command line. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Handling**: The application will read from standard input. You can either type the input directly or redirect from a file. For example:
   ```bash
   echo "5 1 2 2 3 1" | python main.py
   ```

### Output

The application will output the minimum number of colors required to paint the integers based on the specified conditions. For example:
```
Minimum colors required: 3
```

## Example

Given the input:
```
6 1 2 2 3 3 4
```
The output will be:
```
Minimum colors required: 4
```

## Error Handling

- If the number of integers provided does not match `N`, the application will raise a `ValueError` indicating the mismatch.

## Conclusion

The Color Application is a straightforward tool to determine the minimum number of colors needed for a list of integers. It efficiently handles the input and provides the required output based on the specified conditions. For any further assistance or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
