Task:
Define a function 'min_colors_required(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for finding the minimum number of colors required. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list of integers A from standard input. Sort the list A to facilitate the color assignment while maintaining the condition that if A_i and A_j are painted the same color, then A_i < A_j. Initialize a variable 'color_count' to keep track of the number of colors used. Iterate through the sorted list A and assign colors based on the condition that no two equal integers can share the same color. Use a dictionary or a set to track the last assigned color for each unique integer in A. Update the 'color_count' whenever a new color is assigned to a unique integer. Ensure that the algorithm runs efficiently within the constraints, particularly focusing on the O(N log N) complexity due to sorting. Return the value of 'color_count' as the output of the function. Implement output handling to print the result of 'min_colors_required' to standard output.
