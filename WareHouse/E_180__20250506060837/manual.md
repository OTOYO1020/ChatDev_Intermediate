# Travel Cost Calculator

A Python application designed to calculate the minimum travel cost for visiting multiple cities based on their 3D coordinates.

## Main Functions

The Travel Cost Calculator provides the following key functionalities:

- **Input City Coordinates**: Users can input the coordinates (X, Y, Z) for each city.
- **Calculate Travel Cost**: The application computes the cost of traveling between cities using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Cost} = |X_b - X_a| + |Y_b - Y_a| + \max(0, Z_b - Z_a)
  \]
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: The application implements a recursive approach with memoization to find the minimum travel cost to visit all cities and return to the starting city.

## Installation

To run the Travel Cost Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd travel-cost-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   The application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application directly using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Start the Application**:
   Run the `main.py` script. You will be prompted to enter the number of cities.

2. **Input City Coordinates**:
   For each city, input the coordinates in the format `X,Y,Z`. For example:
   ```
   Enter coordinates for city 1 (format: X,Y,Z): 1,2,3
   ```

   If the input is invalid, you will have up to 3 attempts to enter the correct format. After 3 failed attempts, the program will exit.

3. **View Minimum Travel Cost**:
   Once all cities have been entered, the application will calculate and display the minimum travel cost to visit all cities and return to the starting city:
   ```
   Minimum Travel Cost: <calculated_cost>
   ```

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of cities: 3
Enter coordinates for city 1 (format: X,Y,Z): 0,0,0
Enter coordinates for city 2 (format: X,Y,Z): 1,1,1
Enter coordinates for city 3 (format: X,Y,Z): 2,2,2
Minimum Travel Cost: 4
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the coordinates are integers and follow the specified format to avoid input errors.
- The application is designed for command-line usage and does not include a graphical user interface (GUI).
