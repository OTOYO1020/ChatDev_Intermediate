Define a function 'count_valid_integers(N: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for counting valid integers X. Implement input handling to read the integer N from standard input. Check that the input N satisfies the constraint '2 <= N <= 10^6'. Initialize a variable 'mod' with the value '998244353' to handle the modulo operation. Create a dynamic programming table 'dp' where 'dp[i][j]' represents the number of valid integers of length i ending with digit j. Set the base case for 'dp[1][j]' to 1 for all j from 1 to 9, since single-digit integers are valid. Iterate through lengths from 2 to N, and for each length, calculate the valid counts based on the previous length's counts, ensuring the digit difference condition is met. Sum up the values in 'dp[N][j]' for j from 1 to 9 to get the total count of valid integers of length N. Return the total count modulo '998244353'. Print the output of the function call 'count_valid_integers(N)'.
