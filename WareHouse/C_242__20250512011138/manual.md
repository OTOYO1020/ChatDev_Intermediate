# Valid Integer Counter

A Python application for counting valid integers based on specific digit difference conditions.

## Overview

The Valid Integer Counter is designed to calculate the number of valid integers of a given length \( N \), where valid integers are defined by the condition that the absolute difference between consecutive digits is at least 2. This application utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently compute the result.

## Main Functions

- **count_valid_integers(N: int) -> int**: This function encapsulates the logic for counting valid integers of length \( N \). It initializes a dynamic programming table to track valid counts and returns the total count modulo \( 998244353 \).

## Quick Install

To run the Valid Integer Counter, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Currently, there are no additional dependencies required beyond Python's standard library.*

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the program.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Handling**: When prompted, enter an integer \( N \) that satisfies the constraint \( 2 \leq N \leq 10^6 \). The application will validate the input and calculate the count of valid integers of length \( N \).

4. **Output**: The application will print the result, which is the count of valid integers of the specified length.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter an integer N (2 <= N <= 10^6): 5
Count of valid integers of length 5: 120
```

## Error Handling

If the input does not meet the specified constraints, the application will raise an error and prompt the user to enter a valid integer.

```plaintext
Input Error: N must be between 2 and 10^6.
```

## Conclusion

The Valid Integer Counter is a powerful tool for counting valid integers based on digit difference conditions. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can easily integrate this functionality into your projects or use it as a standalone application.
