Define the function 'increment_counters(N: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int]], Q: int, operations: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the number of vertices 'N', the list of edges, the number of operations 'Q', and the list of operations. Construct the tree using an adjacency list representation from the given edges. Implement a function to perform a Depth First Search (DFS) to determine the subtree of each vertex and store the subtree vertices. For each operation, increment the counters of all vertices in the subtree rooted at 'p_j' by 'x_j'. Use an efficient method to handle multiple increments on subtree vertices, possibly using a lazy propagation technique. After processing all operations, compute the final counter values for each vertex. Return the final counter values as a list of integers. Ensure that the function handles the constraints efficiently, especially for large values of 'N' and 'Q'. Format the output as a list of integers representing the counter values for each vertex from '1' to 'N'.
