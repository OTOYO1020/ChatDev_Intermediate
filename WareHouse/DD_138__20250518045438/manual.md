# Increment Counters Application

A Python application designed to efficiently manage and increment counters in a tree structure based on user-defined operations.

## Main Functions

The Increment Counters Application provides the following key functionalities:

- **Tree Construction**: Builds a tree structure from a list of edges.
- **Subtree Management**: Efficiently manages subtree operations using lazy propagation.
- **Counter Increment Operations**: Allows users to increment counters for all vertices in a specified subtree.
- **Final Counter Retrieval**: Computes and returns the final counter values for each vertex after all operations have been applied.

## Installation

To run the Increment Counters Application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You will need the following Python packages:

- `tkinter` (for GUI)
- `typing` (for type hints)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

Note: `tkinter` is included with most Python installations, but if you encounter issues, please refer to your operating system's documentation for installation instructions.

## How to Use the Application

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository containing the application files.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located.

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

### User Interface Instructions

Once the application is running, you will see a graphical user interface (GUI) with the following input fields:

1. **Number of Vertices (N)**: Enter the total number of vertices in the tree.

2. **Edges (u,v)**: Input the edges of the tree in the format `u,v;u,v;...` (e.g., `1,2;1,3;2,4`).

3. **Number of Operations (Q)**: Specify the number of operations you want to perform.

4. **Operations (p,x)**: Enter the operations in the format `p,x;p,x;...` (e.g., `1,5;2,3`), where `p` is the root of the subtree and `x` is the increment value.

5. **Submit Button**: Click the "Submit" button to process the input.

### Viewing Results

After submitting the input, the application will display the final counter values for each vertex in the tree. The results will be shown below the input fields.

## Example Usage

1. **Input Example**:
   - Number of Vertices (N): `4`
   - Edges (u,v): `1,2;1,3;2,4`
   - Number of Operations (Q): `2`
   - Operations (p,x): `1,5;2,3`

2. **Expected Output**:
   - Final Counters: `[5, 8, 0, 3]`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the application, please ensure that:

- All input values are correctly formatted.
- The number of edges is exactly `N-1` for a valid tree.
- The tree is connected and all nodes are reachable.
