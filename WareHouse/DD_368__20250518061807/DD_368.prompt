Define the function 'min_vertices_in_tree(N: int, K: int, edges: List[Tuple[int, int]], specified_vertices: List[int])' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the number of vertices 'N', the number of specified vertices 'K', the list of edges, and the list of specified vertices. Construct the tree using an adjacency list representation from the given edges. Implement a function to perform Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to find the minimum subtree that includes all specified vertices. Identify and mark the specified vertices in the tree during the traversal. Calculate the minimum number of vertices required to connect all specified vertices by considering the edges in the traversal. Handle edge cases, such as when K equals 1 or when all specified vertices are directly connected. Return the minimum number of vertices as the output of the function. Ensure that the function handles the maximum constraints efficiently, given N can be up to 200,000. Format the output to display the minimum number of vertices in the required format.
