Define the function 'can_create_sheet(H_A, W_A, A, H_B, W_B, B, H_X, W_X, X)' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract dimensions and representations of sheets A, B, and X. Create a grid representation for sheet C initialized with transparent squares. Implement a method to paste sheets A and B onto sheet C at all possible positions. For each possible position of sheets A and B, create a combined representation of sheet C. Implement a method to check if the cut-out area from sheet C can include all black squares from sheets A and B. Implement a method to check if the cut-out area from sheet C matches the representation of sheet X. Iterate through all possible placements of sheets A and B and check the conditions for each placement. Return True if a valid configuration is found, otherwise return False. Output the result in the format 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the goal can be achieved.
