# Sheet Configuration Checker

A Python application for checking the configuration of sheets based on user-defined dimensions and representations.

## Overview

The Sheet Configuration Checker allows users to determine if two sheets (A and B) can be combined in such a way that they match a target sheet (X). The application checks all possible placements of sheets A and B on a combined sheet C and verifies if the configuration meets the specified criteria.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Accepts dimensions and representations of sheets A, B, and X.
- **Grid Representation**: Initializes a grid for sheet C with transparent squares.
- **Placement Checking**: Checks all possible placements of sheets A and B on sheet C.
- **Matching Verification**: Verifies if the combined representation of sheets A and B matches the representation of sheet X.
- **Output**: Returns 'YES' if a valid configuration is found, otherwise returns 'NO'.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application requires no external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Simply ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the dimensions and representations of sheets A, B, and X in the following format:
   - For sheet A: `H_A,W_A,A`
   - For sheet B: `H_B,W_B,B`
   - For sheet X: `H_X,W_X,X`
   
   Example input:
   ```
   Enter dimensions and representation of sheet A (H_A,W_A,A): 2,3,1;1;0
   Enter dimensions and representation of sheet B (H_B,W_B,B): 2,3,0;1;1
   Enter dimensions and representation of sheet X (H_X,W_X,X): 2,3,1;1;1
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will output either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the goal can be achieved.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the following when prompted:
   ```
   Enter dimensions and representation of sheet A (H_A,W_A,A): 2,3,1;0;0
   Enter dimensions and representation of sheet B (H_B,W_B,B): 2,3,0;1;1
   Enter dimensions and representation of sheet X (H_X,W_X,X): 2,3,1;1;1
   ```

3. The output will be:
   ```
   YES
   ```

## Conclusion

The Sheet Configuration Checker is a powerful tool for validating sheet configurations based on user-defined parameters. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily determine the feasibility of combining sheets A and B to match sheet X.
