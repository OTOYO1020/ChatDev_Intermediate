Define the function 'calculate_f(N: int, A: List[int], T: List[int], X: List[int]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters, where 'N' is the number of elements in sequences A and T, and Q is the number of elements in sequence X. Implement input reading to parse the integer sequences A, T, and X from standard input. Create a loop to iterate over each element in sequence X, where for each 'x_i', we will apply the functions 'f_1', 'f_2', ..., 'f_N' in sequence. Define the function 'f_i(x: int, a_i: int, t_i: int) -> int' to compute the value based on the conditions provided for 't_i'. In the loop from subtask 3, initialize a variable 'result' with the current 'x_i' value before applying the functions. For each 'i' from 1 to N, call 'f_i(result, A[i-1], T[i-1])' to update 'result'. Store the final result after applying all functions for each 'x_i' into a results list. After processing all elements in X, return the results list from the 'calculate_f' function. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as minimum and maximum values for inputs as specified in the constraints. Output the results list in the required format, ensuring each result is printed on a new line.
