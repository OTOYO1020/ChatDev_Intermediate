# ChatDev Calculation Tool

A command-line application for performing sequential calculations based on user-defined sequences.

## Overview

The ChatDev Calculation Tool allows users to input sequences of integers and apply a series of mathematical operations defined by another sequence. This tool is designed to handle various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and integer division based on user input.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads sequences A, T, and X from standard input.
- **Sequential Operations**: For each element in sequence X, the tool applies a series of operations defined by sequences A and T.
- **Error Handling**: The application gracefully handles errors, such as invalid input or division by zero, and provides informative messages.

## Installation

To run the ChatDev Calculation Tool, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

2. **Input Sequences**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of elements in sequences A and T (N).
   - Enter the values for sequence A as space-separated integers.
   - Enter the values for sequence T as space-separated integers.
   - Enter the values for sequence X as space-separated integers.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the number of elements in sequences A and T: 3
   Enter values for A (space-separated): 10 5 2
   Enter values for T (space-separated): 1 2 3
   Enter values for X (space-separated): 20 30
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the sequences, the application will process the input and print the results for each element in sequence X, each on a new line.

   Example output:
   ```
   25
   75
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the lengths of sequences A or T do not match the specified N, an error message will be displayed.
- If sequence X is empty, an error message will indicate that at least one element is required.
- Invalid operation codes in sequence T will raise an error, and the application will skip processing for that element in sequence X.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example of how to use the application:

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Provide input:
   ```
   Enter the number of elements in sequences A and T: 3
   Enter values for A (space-separated): 10 5 2
   Enter values for T (space-separated): 1 2 3
   Enter values for X (space-separated): 20 30
   ```

3. Observe the output:
   ```
   25
   75
   ```

## Conclusion

The ChatDev Calculation Tool is a powerful utility for performing sequential calculations based on user-defined sequences. With its straightforward input handling and robust error management, it is designed to be user-friendly and efficient.
