# Work Days Calculator

A simple application to determine the workdays for Takahashi based on given parameters.

## Overview

The Work Days Calculator allows users to input the total number of days, the number of workdays to select, the cooldown period after selecting a workday, and the availability of each day. The application will then output the specific days Takahashi is bound to work, taking into account the cooldown period and unavailable days.

## Main Functions

- **find_work_days(N: int, K: int, C: int, S: str) -> List[int]**: This function encapsulates the logic to determine the workdays based on the input parameters:
  - `N`: Total number of days.
  - `K`: Number of workdays to select.
  - `C`: Cooldown period after selecting a workday.
  - `S`: A string representing the availability of each day ('x' for unavailable, '.' for available).
  
  The function returns a list of integers representing the days Takahashi will work.

## Installation

To run the Work Days Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary dependencies (if any).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If there are no additional dependencies, you can skip this step.*

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain the integer `N` (total number of days).
   - The second line should contain the integer `K` (number of workdays to select).
   - The third line should contain the integer `C` (cooldown period).
   - The fourth line should contain the string `S` (availability string).

   Example input:
   ```
   10
   3
   2
   ..x..x..x.
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application from the command line. Make sure to provide the input through standard input. 

```bash
python main.py
```

3. **View Output**: The output will be a space-separated string of workdays that Takahashi is bound to work. For example:
   ```
   1 4 7
   ```

## Example

Given the following input:
```
10
3
2
..x..x..x.
```

The output will be:
```
1 4 7
```

This indicates that Takahashi will work on days 1, 4, and 7.

## Conclusion

The Work Days Calculator is a straightforward tool designed to help users determine workdays based on specific criteria. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
