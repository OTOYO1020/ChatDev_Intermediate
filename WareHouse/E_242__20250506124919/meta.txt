Task:
Read the integer T from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, read the integer N and the string S of length N. Initialize a variable 'count' to store the number of valid strings X for each test case. Generate the first half of the palindrome string X based on the constraints:\n   - If N is odd, include the middle character in the first half. Check if the generated palindrome X is lexicographically less than or equal to S:\n   - If X equals S, increment 'count' by 1.\n   - If X is less than S, calculate the number of valid palindromes that can be formed. Use modular arithmetic with the modulus '998244353' to ensure the count remains within bounds. Store the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, print the results for each test case on a new line. Ensure efficient handling of input and output to accommodate the upper limits of T and N. Optimize the palindrome generation and comparison to handle the constraints effectively.
