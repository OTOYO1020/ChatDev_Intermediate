# Palindrome Counting Application

A Python application designed to count valid palindrome strings based on given constraints.

## Overview

This application reads multiple test cases, each containing a string, and generates palindromes based on the first half of the string. It counts how many of these palindromes are lexicographically less than or equal to the original string, using modular arithmetic to ensure results remain within bounds.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of test cases and the corresponding strings.
- **Palindrome Generation**: Generates palindromes from the first half of the input string.
- **Count Valid Palindromes**: Compares generated palindromes with the input string and counts valid ones.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Ensures the count remains within the modulus `998244353`.

## Installation

To run the Palindrome Counting Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not have external dependencies beyond Python itself, but ensure you have the latest version of Python.

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Input**: The input should be provided in the following format:

   ```
   T
   N1 S1
   N2 S2
   ...
   NT ST
   ```

   Where `T` is the number of test cases, `N` is the length of the string `S`, and `S` is the string itself.

2. **Run the Application**: Use the command line to execute the main script.

   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```

   Here, `input.txt` is a file containing your test cases formatted as described above.

3. **Output**: The application will print the count of valid palindromes for each test case on a new line.

## Example Input

```
3
5 ababa
4 abcd
6 aabbcc
```

## Example Output

```
1
0
3
```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your input strings are lowercase and do not exceed the maximum length constraints.
- The application is designed to handle large inputs efficiently, but performance may vary based on the complexity of the input strings.

## Support
