Define the function 'max_score(N: int, K: int, R: int, S: int, P: int, T: str) -> int' to calculate the maximum score. Parse the input values for N, K, R, S, P, and T from the input format. Initialize a variable 'score' to 0 to keep track of the total score. Create a list 'last_used' of size K to keep track of the last hand used in the last K rounds. Iterate through each round from 0 to N-1 and determine the optimal hand to play based on the machine's hand and the last used hands. For each round, if the optimal hand results in a win, update the 'score' variable accordingly. Update the 'last_used' list to reflect the current hand played in the round. Ensure that the hand played in the current round does not match the hand used K rounds ago. Return the final score after all rounds have been played. Output the result in the format of an integer representing the maximum score.
