# Stage Clear Application

A Python application designed to calculate the minimum time required to clear multiple game stages a specified number of times.

## Main Functions

The Stage Clear application provides the following functionalities:

- **Calculate Minimum Time**: Computes the total time required to clear each stage a given number of times based on the first clear and subsequent clear times.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input lengths for the first clear times and subsequent clear times match the number of stages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Prompts the user for input and displays the total time required in a clear format.

## Quick Install

To run the Stage Clear application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, ensure you have the following libraries:

- `typing` (for type hints, included in Python 3.5+)

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py`.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Required Values**:
   - **Number of Stages (N)**: Enter the total number of stages in the game.
   - **First Clear Times (A)**: Provide a comma-separated list of integers representing the time taken to clear each stage for the first time.
   - **Subsequent Clear Times (B)**: Provide a comma-separated list of integers representing the time taken to clear each stage for subsequent attempts.
   - **Number of Clears (X)**: Enter the number of times each stage needs to be cleared.

   Example input:
   ```
   Number of Stages (N): 3
   First Clear Times (A) (comma-separated): 10, 20, 30
   Subsequent Clear Times (B) (comma-separated): 5, 10, 15
   Number of Clears (X): 2
   ```

3. **View the Output**: After entering the required values, the application will calculate and display the total time needed to clear the stages the specified number of times.

   Example output:
   ```
   Total Time: 70 units
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling to manage input errors. If the lengths of the lists A and B do not match the number of stages N, or if any other input error occurs, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Stage Clear application is a straightforward tool for calculating the time required to clear game stages multiple times. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily determine the total time needed for their gaming sessions.
