Define a function 'minimum_travel_time(N: int, A: int, B: int, C: int, D: List[List[int]]) -> int' to calculate the minimum travel time from city 1 to city N. Parse the input to extract the number of cities 'N', the constants 'A', 'B', 'C', and the distance matrix 'D'. Initialize a data structure (e.g., a priority queue) to keep track of the minimum travel times to each city. Set the initial travel time to city 1 as 0 and all other cities as infinity. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to explore the cities, considering both transportation options (company car and train). For each city, calculate the travel time to all other cities using both transportation methods and update the minimum times accordingly. Ensure that switching from company car to train is allowed without time cost, but not vice versa. Continue the algorithm until all reachable cities have been processed. Return the minimum travel time to city N from the initialized data structure. Format the output as an integer representing the minimum travel time.
