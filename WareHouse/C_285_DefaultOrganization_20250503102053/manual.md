# Problem ID Index Calculator

A simple application to calculate the index of a problem ID based on its string representation.

## Main Functions

The Problem ID Index Calculator provides the following functionalities:

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input consists only of uppercase letters (A-Z) and does not exceed a specified length.
- **Index Calculation**: Computes the index of the given problem ID string in a sequence of all possible IDs.
- **Total IDs Calculation**: Calculates the total number of problem IDs with lengths less than the given problem ID length.

## Quick Install

To set up the environment for the Problem ID Index Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, you can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: The `requirements.txt` file should contain any necessary dependencies, such as `re` for regular expressions, although it's part of the standard library.)

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Problem ID Index Calculator is designed to help users find the index of a problem ID based on a string input. The index is calculated based on the position of each character in the alphabet and the total number of possible problem IDs with shorter lengths.

### Key Features:

- **User-Friendly Input**: Prompts the user to enter a valid problem ID.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs.
- **1-Indexed Output**: Returns the index in a 1-indexed format, making it intuitive for users.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   To start the application, run the `main.py` file:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Enter Problem ID**:
   When prompted, enter a valid problem ID consisting of uppercase letters only (e.g., "A", "AB", "ZZZ"). Ensure that the length does not exceed 10 characters.

3. **View Output**:
   The application will calculate and display the index of the entered problem ID. If the input is invalid, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

### Example Usage:

```plaintext
Enter Problem ID: AB
Index of Problem ID: 28
```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- **Empty Input**: If no input is provided, an error message will prompt the user to enter a valid Problem ID.
- **Invalid Characters**: If the input contains characters other than uppercase letters, an error message will indicate that only uppercase letters are allowed.
- **Exceeding Length**: If the input exceeds the maximum length (10 characters), an error message will inform the user of the limit.

## Conclusion

The Problem ID Index Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating the index of problem IDs based on user input. With its built-in validation and error handling, it ensures a smooth user experience. For any further assistance, please refer to the code comments or reach out to the development team.
