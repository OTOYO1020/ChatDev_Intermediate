Receive the string 'S' from standard input, which represents the ID of a problem. Initialize a variable 'length' to store the length of the string 'S'. Calculate the total number of problem IDs with lengths less than 'length':\n   - Use the formula 'total_ids = 26^1 + 26^2 + ... + 26^(length - 1)' to compute this. Initialize a variable 'index' to '0' to store the index of the problem ID. For each character in the string 'S', compute its contribution to the index:\n   - For each character 'char' at position 'i' in 'S', calculate its position in the alphabet (0 for 'A', 1 for 'B', ..., 25 for 'Z').\n   - Update 'index' using the formula: 'index += (position_of_char * 26^(length - i - 1))'. Add the 'total_ids' calculated in step 3 to 'index' to get the final index of the problem ID. Since the problem IDs are 1-indexed, increment 'index' by 1. Print the final value of 'index' as the output.
