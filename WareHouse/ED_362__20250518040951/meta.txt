Task:
Define the function 'count_arithmetic_subsequences(N: int, A: List[int]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the length of the sequence and 'A' is the list of integers representing the sequence. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the list 'A' from standard input. Create a helper function 'is_arithmetic_sequence(subseq: List[int]) -> bool' to check if a given subsequence is an arithmetic sequence. Generate all possible subsequences of 'A' using combinations and store them in a list. Iterate through all lengths 'k' from 1 to 'N' and for each length, filter the subsequences to find those of length 'k' that are arithmetic sequences. Count the number of valid arithmetic subsequences of each length 'k' and store the results in a list 'result'. Apply modulo operation with '998244353' to each count in the 'result' list to ensure the output is within the specified range. Return the final 'result' list from the function 'count_arithmetic_subsequences'. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when 'N' is 1 or when all elements in 'A' are the same. Format the output to print the counts of arithmetic subsequences for each length 'k' from 1 to 'N'.
