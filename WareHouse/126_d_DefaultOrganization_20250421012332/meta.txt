Task:
Receive the number of vertices N and the information on N-1 edges (u_i, v_i, w_i) from standard input, and build a tree structure as an undirected graph. Create an adjacency list graph based on the edge information, and record the adjacent vertices and the weights between them for each vertex. Define an array color of length N to store the colors of each vertex, and initialize it to an undefined state. Let the root be vertex 1 (or 0 in 0-indexed mode), and paint that vertex white (0). Search the tree using DFS or BFS. When moving from a visited vertex to an adjacent vertex, determine the color of the next vertex according to the weight w of the edge passed through. If the edge weight w is even, the adjacent vertex has the same color as the current vertex. If the edge weight w is odd, the adjacent vertex has the opposite color to the current vertex. This process ensures that all vertices are assigned colors consistently.Print the contents of the color array as integers 0 or 1 in N lines in the order of the vertex numbers. Each row should display the color of the corresponding vertex (0 for white, 1 for black).
