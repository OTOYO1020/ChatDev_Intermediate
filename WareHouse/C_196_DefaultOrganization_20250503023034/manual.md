# Valid Integer Counter

A simple application for counting valid integers based on specific criteria.

## Overview

This software allows users to input an integer \( N \) and counts how many integers from 1 to \( N \) have an even number of digits, where the two halves of the integer (when split) are equal. This can be useful for various mathematical explorations and educational purposes.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter an integer \( N \).
- **Counting Logic**: The utility function `count_valid_integers(N)` processes the input and counts valid integers based on the defined criteria.
- **Output**: The final count of valid integers is printed to the console.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, so you can run it directly after setting up Python.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input an Integer**: When prompted, enter a positive integer \( N \). The application will then process the input.

3. **View the Output**: After processing, the application will display the count of valid integers that meet the criteria.

### Example

```
Enter an integer N: 100
10
```

In this example, the application counted 10 valid integers between 1 and 100 that have an even number of digits and equal halves.

## Error Handling

- If the user inputs a non-integer value, the application will display an error message:
  ```
  Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.
  ```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to explore the properties of integers based on specific criteria. Feel free to modify the code in `utils.py` to add more features or change the counting logic as needed.
