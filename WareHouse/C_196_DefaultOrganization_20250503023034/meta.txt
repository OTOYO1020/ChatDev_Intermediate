Task:
Read the integer N from standard input. Initialize a counter variable 'count = 0' to keep track of valid integers. Loop through all integers 'x' from 1 to N (inclusive). For each integer 'x', convert it to a string 'str_x'. Check if the length of 'str_x' is even:\n   - If not, skip to the next integer. Split 'str_x' into two halves: 'first_half' and 'second_half'. Compare 'first_half' and 'second_half':\n   - If they are equal, increment 'count' by 1. After the loop, print the final value of 'count'.\n\nOutput format: The output should be a single integer representing the count of valid integers.
