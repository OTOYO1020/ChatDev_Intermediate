   ```

## 3. Using the Score Predictor Application

The Score Predictor application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction. Follow these steps to use the application:

1. After running the application, a window titled "Application" will appear.

2. The window contains a button labeled "Click Me" and a label displaying "Hello World".

3. Click the "Click Me" button to generate a score prediction.

4. In the action listener of the button, you can customize the game type, number of players, and player strategies by modifying the following variables:

   - `gameType`: Replace with the actual game type (e.g., 1 for chess, 2 for Monopoly).
   - `numberOfPlayers`: Replace with the actual number of players in the game.
   - `playerStrategies`: Replace with the actual player strategies separated by commas (e.g., "strategy1, strategy2, strategy3").

5. The application will call the `predictScore` method from the `ScorePredictor` class to generate a predicted score based on the provided game type, number of players, and player strategies.

6. The predicted score will be displayed in the label below the button.
