The code provided is missing the necessary imports for the classes used in the code. Specifically, the javax.swing.* and java.awt.* packages are not imported in the GUI.java file. To fix this, you should add the following import statements at the beginning of the GUI.java file:
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
Additionally, the ScorePredictor class is referenced in the GUI.java file but it is not imported. You should add the following import statement at the beginning of the GUI.java file:
import ScorePredictor;
Once these import statements are added, the code should compile without any errors related to missing classes.
