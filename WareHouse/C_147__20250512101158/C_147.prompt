Define the function 'max_honest_people(N: int, testimonies: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> int' to handle the input parameters, where 'N' is the number of people and 'testimonies' is a list of lists containing tuples of testimonies. Parse the input to extract the number of people 'N' and their respective testimonies 'A_i' for each person. Create a data structure to store the testimonies for each person, ensuring that each testimony is represented as a tuple '(x_{ij}, y_{ij})'. Implement a function to evaluate the honesty of each person based on the testimonies provided, considering the constraints that honest testimonies are always correct. Use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible combinations of honest and unkind persons to determine the maximum number of honest persons. Check each combination of persons to validate the testimonies against the assumed honesty of each person in that combination. Count the number of honest persons in each valid combination and keep track of the maximum count found. Ensure that the algorithm efficiently handles the constraints given the maximum value of 'N' is 15, allowing for a feasible solution space. Return the maximum count of honest persons found from the evaluations. Output the result as an integer representing the maximum number of honest persons.
