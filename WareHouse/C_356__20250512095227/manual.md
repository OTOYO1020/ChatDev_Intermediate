# Key Combination Application

A Python application for counting valid key combinations based on specified test cases.

## Overview

The Key Combination Application allows users to determine the number of valid combinations of keys (real or dummy) based on a series of tests. Each test specifies a set of keys and an expected result, which can either be 'o' (indicating at least K real keys) or 'x' (indicating fewer than K real keys). The application utilizes bit manipulation to efficiently generate and evaluate all possible combinations of keys.

## Main Functions

- **count_valid_key_combinations(N: int, M: int, K: int, tests: List[Tuple[List[int], str]]) -> int**: This function takes the number of keys (N), the number of tests (M), the threshold for real keys (K), and a list of test cases. It returns the count of valid key combinations that satisfy all test conditions.

- **validate_combination(combination: int, N: int, K: int, tests: List[Tuple[List[int], str]]) -> bool**: A helper function that checks if a given combination of keys meets the requirements of the provided tests.

## Installation

To run the Key Combination Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Here’s how:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: If there are no specific dependencies, you can skip this step.)*

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the application**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   When prompted, enter the values for N, M, K, and the test cases. The input should be formatted as follows:
   - The first line should contain three integers: N (total keys), M (number of tests), and K (minimum real keys).
   - Each subsequent line should represent a test case, ending with either 'o' or 'x'. For example:
     ```
     5 3 2
     1 2 o
     3 4 x
     1 3 o
     ```

3. **Understanding the Output**:
   After entering the input, the application will process the data and output the number of valid key combinations that satisfy all the test conditions.

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to run the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter N, M, K and test cases (each test case on a new line):
5 3 2
1 2 o
3 4 x
1 3 o
Valid combinations: 6
```

## Edge Cases

- Ensure that the number of test cases (M) matches the number of provided test lines.
- Key indices must be between 1 and N, and each test case must end with either 'o' or 'x'.
- The application will handle invalid inputs gracefully by providing error messages.

## Conclusion

The Key Combination Application is a powerful tool for evaluating key combinations based on specific criteria. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily determine valid combinations for their needs.
