Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of people and dishes. Read the array 'p' of length N, which contains the dish positions in front of each person. Initialize a variable 'happy_count' to 0 to keep track of the number of happy people. For each person 'i' from 0 to N-1:\n   - Check if the dish 'p[i]' is in front of Person '(i-1) % N', Person 'i', or Person '(i+1) % N'.\n   - If the condition is satisfied, increment 'happy_count' by 1. After checking all persons, compute the result as 'happy_count % m', where 'm' is a given positive integer. Print the final result.\n\nNote: The problem does not specify how 'm' is provided, so it should be assumed to be part of the input or a constant defined elsewhere in the implementation.
