# Happy People Calculator

A simple application to calculate the number of happy people based on dish positions in front of them.

## Overview

The Happy People Calculator reads the number of people and their respective dish positions, then determines how many people are happy based on whether their dish or the dishes of their immediate neighbors are in front of them. The final result is computed modulo a given integer `m`.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads input for the number of people, their dish positions, and the integer `m`.
- **Happy People Calculation**: It calculates the number of happy people based on the dish positions.
- **Output Display**: The result is displayed in a user-friendly format.

## Installation

To run the Happy People Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Prompts**:
   - Enter the number of people (N).
   - Enter the dish positions as a comma-separated list of integers.
   - Enter the value of `m`.

3. **Output**:
   The application will display the number of happy people modulo `m` in the console.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter number of people (N): 5
Enter dish positions (comma-separated integers): 1, 2, 3, 1, 2
Enter value of m: 3
The number of happy people modulo m is: 2
```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure that:
- The number of people must be positive.
- The length of dish positions must match the number of people.
- The value of `m` must be positive.

If any of these conditions are not met, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
