Read integers N and M from standard input, followed by two sequences A and B of length M. Initialize an array 'X' of length N with all values set to -1 (indicating unassigned). Loop through each index 'i' from 0 to M-1:\n   - For each pair (A[i], B[i]), check the current values of 'X[A[i]-1]' and 'X[B[i]-1]'.\n   - If both are unassigned (-1), assign 'X[A[i]-1] = 0' and 'X[B[i]-1] = 1'.\n   - If one is assigned, ensure they are different; if they are the same, print No and exit. After processing all pairs, check if any pair (A[i], B[i]) violates the condition 'X[A[i]-1] != X[B[i]-1]'. If all pairs satisfy the condition, print Yes.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function: 'is_good_pair(N, M, A, B)'\n- Variables: 'X', 'i', 'A', 'B'\n\n### Input Format:\n- Input will be read from standard input in the format: first line contains N and M, followed by M lines of integers for sequences A and B.\n\n### Output Format:\n- The output will be either Yes or No based on whether the sequences form a good pair.
