# Good Pair Checker

A simple application to determine if two sequences of integers form a "good pair" based on specific conditions.

## Main Functions

The Good Pair Checker provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers N and M, followed by two sequences A and B of length M.
- **Array Initialization**: Initializes an array X of length N with all values set to -1 (indicating unassigned).
- **Pair Checking**: Loops through each index to check pairs (A[i], B[i]) and assigns values in X based on the conditions specified.
- **Validation**: Ensures that assigned values in X for pairs (A[i], B[i]) are different. If any condition is violated, it outputs "No"; otherwise, it outputs "Yes".

## Installation

To run the Good Pair Checker, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

You may need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can run the following command to install any necessary packages:

```bash
pip install sys
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository containing the Good Pair Checker code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application using the command line. The application reads input from standard input.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: Provide the input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain two integers N and M.
   - The next M lines should each contain two integers representing the sequences A and B.

   Example Input:
   ```
   5 3
   1 2
   2 3
   4 5
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will output either "Yes" or "No" based on whether the sequences form a good pair.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the Good Pair Checker:

```bash
$ python main.py
5 3
1 2
2 3
4 5
```

Output:
```
Yes
```

## Additional Information

For more detailed information about the implementation, please refer to the source code in `good_pair.py` and `main.py`. The logic for checking the pairs is encapsulated in the `is_good_pair` function.
