Task:
Define the function 'calculate_max_value(N: int, M: int, X: int, C: List[int], A: List[List[int]]) -> int' to handle the input parameters. Implement input handling to read integers N, M, X, and lists C and A from standard input. Validate that N and M are within the range [1, 12]. Validate that X is within the range [1, 100000]. Validate that each element in list C is within the range [1, 100000]. Validate that each element in the 2D list A is within the range [0, 100000]. Implement the logic to calculate the maximum value based on the given constraints and input data. Store the result of the calculation in a variable 'max_value'. Return the 'max_value' from the function 'calculate_max_value'. Output the result in the required format, ensuring it is an integer.
