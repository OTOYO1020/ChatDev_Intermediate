# Max Value Calculator

A Python application for calculating the maximum value based on given constraints and input data.

## Overview

The Max Value Calculator allows users to input parameters and compute the maximum value that can be achieved based on a budget and associated costs. This tool is particularly useful for optimization problems where resources are limited.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads integers and lists from standard input, ensuring that all inputs are validated according to specified constraints.
- **Validation**: The software checks that the inputs are within defined ranges and formats, providing error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Calculation Logic**: Implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum value based on the provided costs and benefits.

## Installation

To run the Max Value Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## Usage

To use the Max Value Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the parameters**:
   The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - **N**: Number of items (1-12)
   - **M**: Number of options per item (1-12)
   - **X**: Budget (1-100000)
   - **C**: A list of costs (comma-separated values, each between 1 and 100000)
   - **A**: A 2D list of benefits (semicolons separating rows, commas separating values)

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter N (1-12): 3
   Enter M (1-12): 2
   Enter X (1-100000): 10
   Enter C (comma-separated values, 1-100000): 5,3,4
   Enter A (2D list as semicolon-separated rows of comma-separated values): 10,20;30,40;50,60
   ```

3. **View the result**:
   After entering the inputs, the application will calculate and display the maximum value:
   ```
   Max Value: <calculated_value>
   ```

## Error Handling

If the input does not meet the specified criteria, the application will return an error message indicating the issue. Ensure that all inputs are within the defined ranges and formats.

## Conclusion

The Max Value Calculator is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems with constraints. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily compute maximum values based on their input data.
