Task:
Read integers N and T from standard input. Read an array A of length N, which contains the durations of each song in seconds. Calculate the total duration of the playlist by summing all elements in array A. Compute the effective time 'T % total_duration' to determine the time within the current cycle of the playlist. Initialize a variable 'elapsed_time = 0' to track the cumulative time as songs are played. Iterate through each song in the playlist:\n   - For each song 'i', add 'A[i]' to 'elapsed_time'.\n   - Check if 'elapsed_time' exceeds the effective time calculated in step 4.\n   - If it does, identify the current song as 'i + 1' (1-based index) and calculate the seconds passed since the start of that song as 'elapsed_time - A[i]'.\n   - Break the loop once the current song is found. Print the current song number and the seconds passed since it started playing. \n\nThis breakdown ensures that we handle the input correctly, compute the necessary values, and produce the output in the required format.
