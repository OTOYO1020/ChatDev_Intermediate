# Takahashi vs Aoki Game

A fun interactive game where players take turns declaring integers. The goal is to avoid declaring a number that has already been declared, and the game ends when Aoki declares zero.

## Main Functions

- **Declare Integer**: The application will declare an integer between 1 and 2N+1 that has not been declared yet.
- **Input Handling**: Players (Aoki) can declare integers, and the game checks for duplicates and termination conditions.
- **Game Flow**: The game continues until Aoki declares 0, indicating Takahashi has won.

## Quick Install

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: If there are specific dependencies, please create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary packages.)

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This application is a simple interactive game where two players take turns declaring integers. The game logic ensures that players cannot declare the same integer twice, and it provides a fun way to engage with basic programming concepts.

## ðŸ“– How to Use/Play

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the main script to start the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Integer N**:
   - When prompted, enter an integer N (1-1000). This will determine the range of integers that can be declared.

3. **Game Play**:
   - The application will declare an integer for Takahashi.
   - Aoki must then declare an integer in response.
   - If Aoki declares 0, the game ends, and Takahashi wins.
   - If Aoki declares an integer that has already been declared, the game will prompt for a valid input again.

4. **End of Game**:
   - The game will automatically terminate when Aoki declares 0 or if there are no more integers left to declare.

## Error Handling

- If N is not within the range of 1 to 1000, an error message will be displayed.
- If Aoki declares an integer outside the valid range (0 to 2N+1), an error message will prompt for a valid input.
- If a non-integer value is entered, an error message will prompt for a valid integer.

## Conclusion

Enjoy playing the Takahashi vs Aoki game! It's a great way to practice your programming skills while having fun. For any issues or feedback, please contact the support team.
