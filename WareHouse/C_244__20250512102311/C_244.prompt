Read the integer N from Standard Input, ensuring it falls within the range of 1 to 1000. Initialize a set to keep track of declared integers to avoid duplicates. Start a loop that continues until the game ends (i.e., until Aoki declares 0). In each iteration of the loop, declare an integer between 1 and 2N+1 that has not been declared yet, and output it to Standard Output. Flush the Standard Output after each declaration to avoid TLE. Read the integer declared by Aoki from Standard Input. Check if Aoki's declared integer is 0; if so, terminate the program immediately as Takahashi has won. Add both Takahashi's and Aoki's declared integers to the set of declared integers. Ensure that the program adheres to the rules by not declaring any integers that have already been declared. Output must be formatted correctly, and the program must terminate immediately after the game ends.
