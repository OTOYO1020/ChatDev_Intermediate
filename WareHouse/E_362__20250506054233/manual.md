# Arithmetic Subsequence Counter

A Python application for counting arithmetic subsequences in a given sequence of integers.

## Quick Install

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, ensure you have `itertools` and `collections` modules, which are part of the Python standard library.*

## ü§î What is this?

The Arithmetic Subsequence Counter is designed to read a sequence of integers and count the number of valid arithmetic subsequences of varying lengths. An arithmetic subsequence is defined as a sequence where the difference between consecutive elements is constant.

### Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer `N` representing the length of the sequence, followed by the sequence `A` of integers.
- **Counting Arithmetic Subsequences**: The core functionality is encapsulated in the `count_arithmetic_subsequences` method, which generates all possible subsequences of length `k` and checks if they form an arithmetic sequence.
- **Output**: The application prints the count of arithmetic subsequences for each length from 1 to N.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Data**: When prompted, enter the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself. For example:

   ```
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```

   Here, `5` is the length of the sequence, and `1 2 3 4 5` are the elements of the sequence.

3. **View the Results**: The application will output the count of arithmetic subsequences for each length from 1 to N, each on a new line. For the above input, the output might look like:

   ```
   5
   10
   10
   5
   1
   ```

## üìö Code Structure

- **main.py**: The main application file that handles input and output.
- **arithmetic_subsequence.py**: The module that contains the logic for counting arithmetic subsequences.

### Key Classes and Methods

- **ArithmeticSubsequence**: A class that encapsulates the logic for counting arithmetic subsequences.
  - `count_arithmetic_subsequences(A)`: Counts the number of arithmetic subsequences for all lengths from 1 to N.
  - `is_arithmetic(subseq)`: Checks if a given subsequence forms an arithmetic sequence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

This application relies on the following Python modules:
- `collections`: For using `defaultdict`.
- `itertools`: For generating combinations of subsequences.

Both modules are included in the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.
