Read the integer N from standard input, representing the length of the sequence A. Read the sequence A of length N, which consists of integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. Initialize a variable 'modulo = 998244353' to store the modulo value for calculations. Create a function 'count_arithmetic_subsequences(A, k)' that takes the sequence A and an integer k as arguments. Inside 'count_arithmetic_subsequences', generate all possible subsequences of length k from A. For each subsequence, check if it forms an arithmetic sequence:\n   - Calculate the common difference and verify if the difference between consecutive elements is constant. Count the valid arithmetic subsequences and take the result modulo 'modulo'. Loop through k from 1 to N, calling 'count_arithmetic_subsequences(A, k)' for each k. Store the results for each k in a list or array. Print the results for all k from 1 to N, each on a new line.
