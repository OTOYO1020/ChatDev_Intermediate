Read the 3x3 bingo card values into a 2D array 'A' from standard input. Read the integer 'N' which represents the number of chosen numbers. Read the 'N' chosen numbers into a list 'b' from standard input. Create a set 'marked_numbers' to store the numbers from the bingo card that are also in the list 'b'. Iterate through the 2D array 'A' and check if each number is in the list 'b'. If it is, add it to 'marked_numbers'. Define a function 'check_bingo(marked_numbers)' to determine if there are three marked numbers in a row, column, or diagonal.\n   - Check each row for three marked numbers.\n   - Check each column for three marked numbers.\n   - Check both diagonals for three marked numbers. Call 'check_bingo(marked_numbers)' to evaluate if a bingo has occurred. Based on the result from 'check_bingo', prepare the output. Print 'BINGO' if a bingo is found; otherwise, print 'NO BINGO'.
