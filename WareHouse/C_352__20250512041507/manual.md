# Giant Height Calculator

Calculate the maximum head height of giants based on their shoulder and head heights.

## Quick Install

To install the necessary dependencies for the Giant Height Calculator, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This software is compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

## 🤔 What is this?

The Giant Height Calculator is a Python application designed to compute the maximum head height of a group of giants based on their respective shoulder and head heights. By generating all possible permutations of the giants, the application determines which arrangement yields the tallest head height for the topmost giant.

### Main Functions

- **max_head_height(N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int**: This function accepts the number of giants and their respective shoulder and head heights. It calculates the maximum head height of the topmost giant across all permutations of the giants.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   To start the application, execute the `main.py` file:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Giants**:
   When prompted, enter the number of giants (N). For example:
   ```
   Enter the number of giants (N): 3
   ```

3. **Input Shoulder Heights**:
   Enter the shoulder heights (A) as a comma-separated list. For example:
   ```
   Enter shoulder heights (A) (comma-separated): 10,20,30
   ```

4. **Input Head Heights**:
   Enter the head heights (B) as a comma-separated list. For example:
   ```
   Enter head heights (B) (comma-separated): 5,15,25
   ```

5. **View the Result**:
   The application will compute and display the maximum head height of the topmost giant based on the input provided:
   ```
   Maximum Head Height: 55
   ```

## 🛠️ Edge Cases

- If the number of giants (N) is zero, the application will return a head height of 0.
- Ensure that the lengths of the shoulder heights (A) and head heights (B) match the number of giants (N) to avoid errors.

## 🧪 Testing

The application has been designed to handle various test cases, including edge cases. You can modify the input values to test different scenarios and validate the correctness and performance of the function.
