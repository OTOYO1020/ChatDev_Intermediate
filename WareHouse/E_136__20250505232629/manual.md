# GCD and Max Divisor Calculator

A simple application to compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of a sequence after performing a specified number of operations.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of elements (N), the maximum number of operations (K), and the sequence of integers (A) from standard input.
- **GCD Calculation**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in the sequence.
- **Max Divisor Calculation**: Determines the maximum possible positive integer divisor after considering the allowed operations.
- **Error Handling**: Validates inputs and provides error messages for incorrect inputs.

## Installation

To run the GCD and Max Divisor Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application requires no additional dependencies beyond the standard Python library. However, if you wish to use a virtual environment, you can set one up as follows:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** or download the files `main.py` and `gcd_calculator.py` to your local machine.

2. **Run the application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the files are located, and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**:
   - The program will prompt you to enter the following:
     - An integer `N` (the number of elements in the sequence).
     - An integer `K` (the maximum number of operations).
     - A sequence of `N` positive integers separated by spaces.

   Example input:
   ```
   5
   3
   10 20 30 40 50
   ```

4. **Output**:
   - The program will output the maximum possible positive integer divisor after performing the operations.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The application will provide error messages for invalid inputs, such as:
     - If `N` is not a positive integer.
     - If `K` is a negative integer.
     - If the number of elements in the sequence does not match `N`.
     - If any element in the sequence is not a positive integer.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
5
3
10 20 30 40 50
```

Output:
```
155
```

## Conclusion

The GCD and Max Divisor Calculator is a straightforward tool for computing divisors based on user-defined parameters. Ensure to follow the input format and handle any errors as indicated. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our support team.
