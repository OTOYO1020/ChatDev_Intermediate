Read the integer N (the number of elements in the sequence) and the integer K (the maximum number of operations) from standard input. Read the sequence of integers A from standard input, ensuring it contains N elements. Initialize a variable 'max_divisor' to store the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after performing the operations. Calculate the initial greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in A using a function 'calculate_gcd(A)'. Determine the total sum of the elements in A and store it in a variable 'total_sum'. Calculate the minimum value in A and store it in a variable 'min_value'. Compute the maximum possible positive integer divisor by considering the effect of K operations:\n   - If 'K' is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between 'min_value' and 1, adjust 'max_divisor' to be 'total_sum + K'.\n   - Otherwise, adjust 'max_divisor' to be 'total_sum - K'. Ensure that 'max_divisor' is positive; if not, set it to 0. Print the value of 'max_divisor' as the final output. Ensure all operations respect the constraints provided in the problem statement (e.g., N, A_i, K).
