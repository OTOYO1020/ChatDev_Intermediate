# Permutation Calculator

A simple application for calculating the resulting permutation from a given input permutation.

## Overview

The Permutation Calculator reads an integer N representing the length of a permutation and an array P of integers. It computes a new permutation Q based on the input, where each index in Q corresponds to the position of the integers in P. This application is designed to be straightforward and efficient for users needing to manipulate permutations.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer N and a permutation P from standard input.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the permutation contains unique values from 1 to N.
- **Permutation Calculation**: Computes the resulting permutation Q based on the input permutation P.
- **Output**: Prints the resulting permutation Q as space-separated integers.

## Installation

To run the Permutation Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file if you want to manage dependencies. For this application, you may not need any additional libraries, but you can include common ones for future scalability. Hereâ€™s an example:
   ```plaintext
   # requirements.txt
   # Add any future dependencies here
   ```

   Install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - First, enter the integer N (length of the permutation).
   - On the next line, enter the permutation P as space-separated integers.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   2 3 1 5 4
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The application will print the resulting permutation Q as space-separated integers.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   3 1 2 5 4
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:
- If the input permutation does not contain unique values from 1 to N, a `ValueError` will be raised.
- Any unexpected errors will be caught and printed to the console.

## Future Enhancements

This application can be extended with additional features such as:
- Support for larger permutations.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Integration with other mathematical libraries for advanced permutation operations.
