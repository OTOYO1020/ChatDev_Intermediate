Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the permutation. Read the permutation P as an array of integers from standard input, ensuring it has length N. Initialize an array Q of length N to store the resulting permutation. For each index i from 1 to N:\n   - Set Q[p[i-1] - 1] = i (adjusting for zero-based indexing). Print the resulting permutation Q as space-separated integers.
