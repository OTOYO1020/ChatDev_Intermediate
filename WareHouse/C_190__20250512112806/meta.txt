Task:
Define the function 'max_conditions_satisfied(N: int, M: int, K: int, conditions: List[Tuple[int, int]], actions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int' to encapsulate the problem. Parse the input values for N, M, K, conditions, and actions from the input format. Create a data structure to store the conditions as pairs of dishes (A_i, B_i) for easy access. Create a data structure to store the actions as pairs of dishes (C_i, D_i) for each person. Implement a mechanism to simulate the placement of balls on dishes based on the actions of each person. Check for each condition if both dishes A_i and B_i have at least one ball after all actions are performed. Count the number of satisfied conditions after all actions are executed. Optimize the simulation to ensure that all combinations of actions by K people are considered. Return the maximum number of satisfied conditions as the output of the function. Format the output as an integer representing the maximum number of conditions satisfied.
