# Max Conditions Satisfied Simulator

A Python application to simulate the placement of balls on dishes based on actions performed by individuals, and to determine the maximum number of conditions satisfied.

## Main Functions

- **Input Parsing**: Accepts user input for the number of dishes, conditions, and actions.
- **Condition Representation**: Represents conditions as pairs of dishes that need to be satisfied.
- **Action Representation**: Represents actions as pairs of dishes where balls are placed.
- **Simulation Logic**: Simulates all combinations of actions by K people to determine the maximum number of satisfied conditions.

## Quick Install

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the necessary packages (if any) that are used in the code.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

This application allows users to define a set of conditions and actions related to dishes. The goal is to determine how many of the defined conditions can be satisfied based on the actions taken by a specified number of individuals.

### Key Concepts

- **Dishes**: Represented by integers, where each dish can hold balls.
- **Conditions**: Pairs of dishes that need to have at least one ball to be considered satisfied.
- **Actions**: Pairs of dishes where balls are placed as a result of actions taken by individuals.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the following:
   - **N**: The number of dishes (integer).
   - **M**: The number of conditions (integer).
   - **K**: The number of people performing actions (integer).
   - **Conditions**: Enter pairs of dishes (A,B) separated by commas. For example: `0,1, 1,2`.
   - **Actions**: Enter pairs of dishes (C,D) separated by commas. For example: `0,1, 1,2`.

3. **View Results**: After entering the inputs, the application will simulate the actions and output the maximum number of conditions satisfied.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter N (number of dishes), M (number of conditions), K (number of people): 3 2 2
Enter conditions (A,B) separated by commas: 0,1, 1,2
Enter actions (C,D) separated by commas: 0,1, 1,2
Max Conditions Satisfied: 2
```
