# MaxProjects

Calculate the maximum number of projects that can be formed based on department employee counts.

## Overview

The MaxProjects application allows users to determine how many projects can be formed by selecting groups of departments based on their employee counts. This is particularly useful for organizations looking to optimize their resources and manage projects efficiently.

## Main Functions

- **max_projects(N: int, K: int, A: List[int]) -> int**: This function calculates the maximum number of projects that can be formed using K departments. It takes the total number of departments (N), the number of departments required to form a project (K), and a list of employee counts for each department (A).

## Installation

To run the MaxProjects application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install any required libraries (if any) using pip.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Input Values**: The application will prompt you to enter the following values:
   - **N**: The total number of departments.
   - **K**: The number of departments required to form a project.
   - **A**: A comma-separated list of employee counts in each department.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the number of departments (N): 5
   Enter the group size (K): 2
   Enter the number of employees in each department (comma-separated): 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the maximum number of projects that can be formed based on the provided input.

   Example output:
   ```
   Maximum Projects: 30
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter the number of departments (N): 5
Enter the group size (K): 2
Enter the number of employees in each department (comma-separated): 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
Maximum Projects: 30
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the input constraints are satisfied:
  - \(1 \leq K \leq N \leq 200000\)
  - \(1 \leq A_i \leq 10^{12}\)
- The application will raise a ValueError if the number of departments does not match the specified N.
