Input Handling: Read integers 'N' and 'X' from standard input, followed by a list of integers 'L' of length 'N'. This will be handled in the 'read_input()' function, which returns 'N', 'X', and 'L'. / Initialize Variables: Set the initial bounce coordinate 'D' to 0 and initialize a counter 'bounce_count' to 0. / First Bounce Check: Since the first bounce is always at coordinate 0, check if 0 is less than or equal to 'X'. If true, increment 'bounce_count' by 1. / Iterate Over Bounces: Loop through each index 'i' from 1 to 'N' to calculate the subsequent bounce coordinates. / Calculate Bounce Coordinates: For each bounce, update the coordinate 'D' using the formula 'D = D + L[i-1]'. / Check Bounce Condition: Within the loop, check if the current bounce coordinate 'D' is less than or equal to 'X'. If true, increment 'bounce_count' by 1. / Output Result: After the loop, print the value of 'bounce_count', which represents the number of bounces where the coordinate is at most 'X'.
