Here's a detailed user manual for the Bounce Application, formatted in Markdown as requested:

# Bounce Application

A simple application to calculate the number of bounces based on given coordinates and bounce distances.

## Quick Install

To run the Bounce Application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can simply run the application without any additional dependencies as it uses built-in Python libraries.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Bounce Application allows users to input a number of bounces and their respective distances, and calculates how many of those bounces occur within a specified coordinate limit. This can be useful for simulations, games, or any application where bounce mechanics are relevant.

### Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The application reads two integers, `N` (the number of bounces) and `X` (the maximum coordinate limit), followed by a list of integers `L` representing the distances of each bounce.

2. **Bounce Calculation**:
   - The application initializes the bounce coordinate `D` to 0 and counts the number of bounces that occur at or below the coordinate `X`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing the input, the application outputs the total number of bounces that are within the specified coordinate limit.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - When prompted, enter the values for `N` and `X` on the first line, separated by a space. 
   - On the second line, enter the list of integers `L` (the bounce distances), separated by spaces.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   Enter N and X on the first line:
   5 10
   Enter the list of L on the second line:
   2 3 5 1 4
   ```

3. **View Output**:
   - The application will calculate and display the number of bounces that occur at or below the coordinate `X`.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   Number of bounces: 5
   ```

## ðŸ“– Documentation

For further details on the implementation and functions, refer to the code files:

- **`main.py`**: The main entry point of the application.
- **`bounce_calculator.py`**: Contains the logic for calculating the number of bounces.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the code structure:

```python
# main.py
from bounce_calculator import calculate_bounces

def main():
    N, X = map(int, input("Enter N and X on the first line:\n").split())
    L = list(map(int, input("Enter the list of L on the second line:\n").split()))
    bounce_count = calculate_bounces(N, X, L)
    print(f"Number of bounces: {bounce_count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```python
# bounce_calculator.py
def calculate_bounces(N, X, L):
    D = 0
    bounce_count = 0
    if 0 <= X:
        bounce_count += 1
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        D += L[i - 1]
        if D <= X:
            bounce_count += 1
    return bounce_count
```
