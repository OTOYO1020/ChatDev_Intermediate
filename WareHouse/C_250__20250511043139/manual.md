# Gomoku Game

A simple and interactive Gomoku game implemented in Python.

## Quick Install

To run the Gomoku game, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can clone the repository or download the files directly. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tkinter
```

## ðŸ¤” What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a traditional board game where two players take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first to get five of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## ðŸ“– How to Play

### Starting the Game

1. Run the application by executing the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The game will display the current board in the terminal and prompt you to enter the row and column where you want to place your mark.

### Making Moves

- Players take turns entering their moves. The current player will be displayed in the terminal.
- Enter the row (0-14) and column (0-14) for your move.
- If the cell is already occupied, you will receive an "Invalid move!" message, and you can try again.

### Winning the Game

- The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player gets five marks in a row, the game will announce the winner in the terminal.
- To reset the game, you can restart the application.

### GUI Version

If you prefer a graphical interface, you can run the `gomoku_gui.py` file:

```bash
python gomoku_gui.py
```

This will open a window where you can click on the cells to make your moves. The current player and game status will be displayed at the bottom of the window.

### Resetting the Game

- In the GUI version, you can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset Game" button.
- In the terminal version, you will need to restart the application to reset the game.
