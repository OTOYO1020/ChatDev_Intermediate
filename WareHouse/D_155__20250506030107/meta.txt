Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input. Read the array of integers A of length N. Initialize an empty list 'products' to store the products of all pairs. Use a nested loop to iterate through all unique pairs (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N:\n   - Compute the product 'product = A[i] * A[j]'.\n   - Append 'product' to the 'products' list. Sort the 'products' list in ascending order. Retrieve the K-th smallest product from the sorted list (considering 1-based indexing). Print the K-th smallest product as the output.
