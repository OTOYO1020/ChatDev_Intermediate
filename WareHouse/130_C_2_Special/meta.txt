Task:
Input Handling: Read integers W, H, x, and y from standard input, representing the width and height of the rectangle and the coordinates of the point, respectively. / Calculate Total Area: Compute the total area of the rectangle using the formula 'total_area = W * H'. / Determine Maximum Possible Area: Calculate the maximum possible area of the smaller part when the rectangle is divided by a line through (x, y). This is given by 'max_area = total_area / 2'. / Check for Multiple Ways: Determine if there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum area. This occurs if the point (x, y) is exactly at the center of the rectangle, i.e., 'x == W / 2' and 'y == H / 2'. / Output the Result: Print the 'max_area' followed by a space and then '1' if there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum area, otherwise print '0'.
