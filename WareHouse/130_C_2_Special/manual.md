# Rectangle Area Calculator

A simple Python application to calculate the maximum area of a rectangle when divided by a line through a specified point.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: Reads integers representing the width (W), height (H), and coordinates (x, y) of a point within the rectangle.
2. **Calculate Total Area**: Computes the total area of the rectangle using the formula `total_area = W * H`.
3. **Determine Maximum Possible Area**: Calculates the maximum possible area of the smaller part when the rectangle is divided by a line through (x, y) using `max_area = total_area / 2`.
4. **Check for Multiple Ways**: Determines if there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum area, which occurs if the point (x, y) is exactly at the center of the rectangle.
5. **Output the Result**: Prints the `max_area` followed by a space and then `1` if there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum area, otherwise prints `0`.

## Installation

To run the Rectangle Area Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd rectangle_area_calculator
   ```

## Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python itself. Ensure you have Python version 3.x installed.

## Usage

To use the Rectangle Area Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Input Data**: When prompted, enter the width, height, and coordinates (x, y) of the point separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter width, height, x, and y separated by spaces: 10 5 5 2
   ```
3. **View Results**: The application will output the maximum area of the smaller part of the rectangle and indicate whether there are multiple ways to achieve that area. For example:
   ```
   25.0 0
   ```

## Example

- **Input**: `10 5 5 2`
- **Output**: `25.0 0`

This indicates that the maximum area of the smaller part is 25.0 and there are no multiple ways to achieve this area.

## Error Handling

- If you enter non-integer values, the application will prompt you to enter valid integers.
- If the width or height is less than or equal to zero, or if the coordinates are outside the rectangle, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Rectangle Area Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating areas based on user-defined dimensions and coordinates. It is designed for ease of use and provides immediate feedback on the calculations performed.
