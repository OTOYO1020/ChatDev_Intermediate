Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of events. Initialize a list 'events' to store the pairs of integers '(t_i, x_i)' for each event. Loop from 1 to N to read each event and populate the 'events' list with tuples '(t_i, x_i)'. Initialize a dictionary 'potions' to keep track of the count of each potion type. Initialize variables 'current_potions' to track the current number of potions and 'K_min' to track the minimum maximum potions needed. Iterate through each event in 'events':\n   - If 't_i = 1', increment the count of potion type 'x_i' in the 'potions' dictionary and update 'current_potions'.\n   - If 't_i = 2', check if there is at least one potion of type 'x_i' in the 'potions' dictionary:\n     - If yes, decrement the count of potion type 'x_i' and update 'current_potions'.\n     - If no, record that Takahashi cannot defeat all monsters and set a flag for failure. If Takahashi can defeat all monsters, compute 'K_min' as the minimum value of 'current_potions' observed during the adventure. Print the value of 'K_min' and the sequence of actions taken by Takahashi that resulted in achieving 'K_min'. If Takahashi cannot defeat all monsters, print '-1'. \n\nThis structured approach will ensure that all requirements of the problem statement are met, and the solution is implemented effectively.
