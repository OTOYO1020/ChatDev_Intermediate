# Potion Tracking Adventure

Welcome to the Potion Tracking Adventure application! This software allows users to manage potions effectively during their adventure, tracking events of adding and removing potions.

## Main Functions

The Potion Tracking Adventure application includes the following main functions:

- **Add Potion**: Users can add potions of a specific type to their inventory.
- **Remove Potion**: Users can remove potions of a specific type from their inventory.
- **Track Events**: The application tracks a series of events and determines if the user can successfully manage their potions throughout the adventure.
- **Minimum Potions Calculation**: The application calculates the minimum number of potions needed at any point during the adventure.

## Installation

To run the Potion Tracking Adventure application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd potion-tracking-adventure
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install any required dependencies using pip. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: If there are no specific dependencies listed, you can skip this step.)*

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Start the application by executing the main script.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Events**: When prompted, enter the integer `N`, which represents the number of events you want to process.

3. **Enter Events**: For each event, input the event type and potion type in the format `t x`, where:
   - `t` is the event type (1 for adding a potion, 2 for removing a potion).
   - `x` is the potion type (an integer representing the type of potion).

   Example:
   ```
   Enter event (t x): 1 2  # Adds one potion of type 2
   Enter event (t x): 2 2  # Removes one potion of type 2
   ```

4. **View Results**: After processing all events, the application will display:
   - The minimum number of potions needed during the adventure.
   - The sequence of actions taken by Takahashi that led to achieving this minimum.
   - If Takahashi cannot defeat all monsters due to insufficient potions, the application will output `-1`.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the application:

```
Enter the number of events: 3
Enter event (t x): 1 1
Enter event (t x): 1 2
Enter event (t x): 2 1
```

Output:
```
Minimum maximum potions needed: 1
Actions taken by Takahashi:
Added potion type 1
Added potion type 2
