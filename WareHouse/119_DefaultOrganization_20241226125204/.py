The highest priority comment is that the code is missing the necessary imports for the classes used in the WebApplication class. This will result in compilation errors. To fix this, you need to add the appropriate import statements for the required classes.
In the WebApplication class, you are using the following classes:
- JFrame
- JButton
- ActionEvent
- ActionListener
- BorderLayout
- JOptionPane
To fix the issue, add the following import statements at the top of the WebApplication.java file:
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JButton;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import java.awt.BorderLayout;
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;
Once you have added these import statements, the code should compile without any errors.
Please make the necessary changes and retest the application to ensure it is functioning as expected.
