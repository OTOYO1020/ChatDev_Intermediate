Task:
Read integers N and D from standard input, where N is the number of apple trees and D is the inspection range for each inspector. Initialize a variable 'inspectors' to 0 to count the number of inspectors deployed. Initialize a variable 'i' to 1 to represent the current tree being inspected. While 'i' is less than or equal to N:\n   - Increment 'inspectors' by 1 to deploy an inspector at tree 'i'.\n   - Calculate the range of trees that this inspector can cover, which is from 'i-D' to 'i+D'.\n   - Update 'i' to the next tree that is not covered by the current inspector, which is 'i + 2D + 1'. Print the value of 'inspectors' as the minimum number of inspectors needed.
