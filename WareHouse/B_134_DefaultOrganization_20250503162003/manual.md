# Inspector Application

The Inspector Application is designed to efficiently calculate the minimum number of inspectors needed to cover a given number of apple trees based on a specified inspection range. This application is particularly useful for agricultural management and resource allocation.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the number of apple trees (N) and the inspection range (D).
- **Inspector Calculation**: Based on the inputs, the application calculates the minimum number of inspectors required to cover all trees.
- **Output**: The application displays the total number of inspectors needed.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Inspector application, you need to set up your environment and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   You can create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have `pip` installed, then run:
   ```bash

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Required Values**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of apple trees (N). This should be a positive integer.
   - Next, enter the inspection range (D). This should be a non-negative integer.

3. **View the Results**:
   After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the minimum number of inspectors needed to cover all the trees.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of apple trees (N): 10
Enter the inspection range (D): 2
Minimum Inspectors Needed: 3
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-integer value or a negative number for N, the application will prompt you to enter valid input.
- Ensure that N is a positive integer and D is a non-negative integer to avoid errors.

## Conclusion

The Inspector Application is a simple yet effective tool for calculating the necessary resources for tree inspection. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can easily deploy the application and optimize your inspection processes.
