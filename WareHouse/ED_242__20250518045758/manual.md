# Palindromic String Counter

A Python application designed to count valid palindromic strings based on user-defined criteria.

## Overview

The Palindromic String Counter allows users to input a number of test cases, each consisting of a length `N` and a string `S`. The application generates all possible palindromic strings of length `N` using uppercase English letters and counts how many of these strings are lexicographically less than or equal to `S`. The results are returned as a list of integers, each representing the count of valid strings for the respective test case.

## Main Functions

- **count_palindromic_strings(T: int, test_cases: List[Tuple[int, str]]) -> List[int]**: 
  - Takes the number of test cases and a list of tuples containing `N` and `S`.
  - Generates palindromic strings and counts those that are valid according to the specified conditions.
  - Returns a list of counts for each test case.

## Installation

To run the Palindromic String Counter application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the necessary dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

If you do not have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Your Input

The application expects input in the following format:
- The first line should contain an integer `T`, the number of test cases.
- The next `T` lines should each contain two values: an integer `N` (the length of the palindromic string) and a string `S` (the reference string).

### Step 2: Run the Application

You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Input Example

When prompted, enter your test cases in the specified format. For example:

```
2
3 ABC
4 DEFG
```

### Step 4: View Results

After entering the input, the application will process the test cases and output the results as a list of integers. Each integer corresponds to the count of valid palindromic strings for the respective test case.

## Example Output

For the input:
```
2
3 ABC
4 DEFG
```

The output might look like:
```
[1, 0]
```

This indicates that there is 1 valid palindromic string of length 3 that is less than or equal to "ABC" and 0 valid palindromic strings of length 4 that are less than or equal to "DEFG".

## Conclusion

The Palindromic String Counter is a powerful tool for generating and counting palindromic strings based on user-defined criteria. For any questions or support, please reach out to our development team.
