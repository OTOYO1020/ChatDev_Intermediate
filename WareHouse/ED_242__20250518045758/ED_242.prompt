Define a function 'count_palindromic_strings(T: int, test_cases: List[Tuple[int, str]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input format, where 'T' is the number of test cases and 'test_cases' is a list of tuples containing each 'N' and 'S'. Implement a loop to iterate through each test case in 'test_cases'. For each test case, extract the integer 'N' and the string 'S' from the tuple. Generate all possible palindromic strings 'X' of length 'N' consisting of uppercase English letters. Check if each generated string 'X' is lexicographically less than or equal to 'S'. Count the valid palindromic strings 'X' that satisfy the conditions and store the result for each test case. Apply the modulo operation with '998244353' to the count of valid strings for each test case. Return the results as a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the count of valid strings for each test case. Ensure that the implementation is efficient to handle the constraints, particularly the upper limits of 'T' and the sum of 'N'. Output the results in the format of a list of integers, each representing the count of valid palindromic strings for the respective test case.
