Task:
Define a function 'process_queries(Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input format, where 'Q' is the number of queries and 'queries' is a list of tuples representing the queries. Initialize an empty list 'queue' to represent the queue of snakes and a variable 'head_positions' to track the head coordinates of each snake. Iterate through each query in 'queries'. For each query of type 1, extract the length 'l' and append a tuple '(head_position, l)' to 'queue', updating 'head_position' accordingly. For queries of type 2, remove the first snake from 'queue', retrieve its length 'm', and adjust the head positions of the remaining snakes in 'queue' by subtracting 'm' from each head coordinate. For queries of type 3, extract the index 'k' and retrieve the head coordinate of the 'k'-th snake from the front of the queue, appending this value to a results list. Ensure that all operations on the queue maintain the correct order and integrity of the data structure. Implement error handling to ensure that the constraints of the problem are respected, particularly for types 2 and 3 queries. After processing all queries, return the results list containing the outputs for all type 3 queries. Test the function with various input scenarios to ensure correctness and efficiency, particularly with the maximum constraints. Format the output of the function as a list of integers, which represent the head coordinates for each type 3 query processed.
