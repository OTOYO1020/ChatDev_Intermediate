# Song Player

A simple command-line application to find the current song and elapsed time based on a playlist and total elapsed time.

## Quick Install

To run the Song Player application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Song Player application allows users to input a list of song durations and a total elapsed time. The application calculates which song is currently playing and how much time has elapsed since the start of that song. This is particularly useful for users who want to track their listening experience in a playlist.

### Main Functions

- **Input Number of Songs (N)**: Specify how many songs are in your playlist.
- **Input Song Durations (A)**: Provide the durations of each song in seconds, separated by spaces.
- **Input Total Time (T)**: Enter the total time elapsed since the start of the playlist.

The application will return the index of the current song (1-based) and the elapsed time since it started.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of songs, their durations, and the total elapsed time. For example:

   ```
   Enter number of songs (N): 3
   Enter song durations (A) separated by space: 240 180 300
   Enter total time (T): 500
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the data, the application will output the current song index and the elapsed time since it started. For example:

   ```
   Current Song Index: 2, Elapsed Time: 140 seconds
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for common input issues:

- If the number of durations does not match the specified number of songs (N), an error message will be displayed.
- If any song duration is zero or negative, or if the total time (T) is negative, appropriate error messages will be shown.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how the application works:

1. Start the application.
2. Input the number of songs: `3`
3. Input the song durations: `240 180 300`
4. Input the total time: `500`
5. The output will indicate which song is currently playing and how much time has elapsed since it started.

## Conclusion

The Song Player application is a straightforward tool for managing and tracking your listening experience. With its simple command-line interface, it allows users to easily input their playlists and get real-time feedback on their current song and elapsed time.
