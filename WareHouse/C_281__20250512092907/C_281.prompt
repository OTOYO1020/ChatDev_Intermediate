Define a function 'find_current_song_and_time(N: int, A: List[int], T: int) -> Tuple[int, int]' to encapsulate the logic for finding the current song and the elapsed time. Parse the input to extract the number of songs 'N', the list of song durations 'A', and the time 'T'. Calculate the total duration of the playlist by summing up all elements in the list 'A'. Determine how many complete cycles of the playlist fit into 'T' by calculating 'T // total_duration'. Calculate the remaining time after the last complete cycle using 'T % total_duration'. Iterate through the list 'A' to find which song is playing at the remaining time. Keep track of the elapsed time since the start of the current song during the iteration. Return the index of the current song (1-based) and the elapsed time since it started as a tuple. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as the maximum constraints for 'N', 'T', and 'A'. Format the output as specified, returning the song index and elapsed time in a readable format.
