# Sequence Processor

A Python application for processing sequences of integers to ensure that every pair of adjacent terms has an absolute difference of 1.

## Main Functions

The Sequence Processor provides the following main functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads a sequence of integers from standard input.
- **Sequence Processing**: Checks the sequence for adjacent terms with an absolute difference of 1 and inserts necessary integers to meet this condition.
- **Output Generation**: Outputs the final processed sequence as space-separated integers.

## Installation

To run the Sequence Processor, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any required dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: The current implementation does not require any external libraries, so you may not need a `requirements.txt` file.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file, and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Sequence**: When prompted, enter a sequence of integers separated by spaces. For example:

   ```
   Enter a sequence of integers (space-separated): 1 2 4 5
   ```

3. **View the Output**: After processing the sequence, the application will display the final sequence. For example:

   ```
   Processed Sequence: 1 2 3 4 5
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how the application works:

- **Input**: `1 3 5`
- **Processing**: The application will identify that the absolute difference between `1` and `3` is not `1`, so it will insert `2` between them. Then it will check `3` and `5`, inserting `4`.
- **Output**: `1 2 3 4 5`

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- **Empty Input**: If no integers are entered, the application will prompt the user to enter a non-empty sequence.
- **Invalid Input**: If the input contains non-integer values, the application will notify the user to enter valid integers.

## Conclusion

The Sequence Processor is a simple yet effective tool for ensuring that sequences of integers meet specific adjacency conditions. By following the instructions above, users can easily install and run the application to process their integer sequences.
