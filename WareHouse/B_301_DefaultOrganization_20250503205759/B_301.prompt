Read the integer N and the sequence A from standard input. Initialize a loop to repeatedly check the sequence A until the termination condition is met. Check if every pair of adjacent terms in A has an absolute difference of 1:\n   - If true, terminate the loop. If false, find the first pair of adjacent terms A[i] and A[i+1] where the absolute difference is not 1. Determine the insertion values based on the comparison of A[i] and A[i+1]:\n   - If A[i] < A[i+1], generate the sequence from A[i]+1 to A[i+1]-1 and insert it between A[i] and A[i+1].\n   - If A[i] > A[i+1], generate the sequence from A[i]-1 down to A[i+1]+1 and insert it between A[i] and A[i+1]. Update the sequence A with the newly inserted values. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until the termination condition is satisfied. Once the loop ends, prepare the final sequence A for output. Print the final sequence A as space-separated integers.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function: 'insert_numbers(A)'\n- Variables: 'N', 'A', 'i', 'inserted_values' (for the generated sequences)
