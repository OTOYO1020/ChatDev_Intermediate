# Typing Time Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum time required to type a given string considering Caps Lock functionality.

## Main Functions

The Typing Time Calculator allows users to input a string and the time taken to press keys, including:

- **Time to press 'A' or 'a' (X)**: The time taken to press the lowercase or uppercase 'a' without using Shift or Caps Lock.
- **Time to press Shift + 'A' or 'a' (Y)**: The time taken to press the uppercase 'A' using the Shift key.
- **Time to toggle Caps Lock (Z)**: The time taken to toggle the Caps Lock state on or off.

The application calculates the total time required to type the input string based on the provided parameters.

## Installation

To run the Typing Time Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine. If you don't have it, you can create the files manually as described below.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. You may need to install the Tkinter library if it is not already included with your Python installation. Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python on Windows and macOS. For Linux, you can install it using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file. You can do this by navigating to the directory in your terminal and running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the String**: In the application window, enter the string you want to calculate the typing time for in the "Enter string (S):" field.

3. **Enter Time Values**:
   - Fill in the time to press 'A' or 'a' (X).
   - Fill in the time to press Shift + 'A' or 'a' (Y).
   - Fill in the time to toggle Caps Lock (Z).

4. **Calculate Time**: Click the "Calculate Time" button to compute the total time required to type the string based on your inputs.

5. **View Results**: The total time will be displayed below the button.

## Example Usage

- **Input String**: `AaAa`
- **X (Time to press 'A' or 'a')**: `1`
- **Y (Time to press Shift + 'A' or 'a')**: `2`
- **Z (Time to toggle Caps Lock)**: `3`

After clicking "Calculate Time", the application will compute the total time based on the logic defined in `typing_logic.py`.

## Conclusion

The Typing Time Calculator is a straightforward tool designed to help users understand the time dynamics of typing with Caps Lock functionality. Feel free to modify the source code to enhance its features or adapt it to your specific needs.
