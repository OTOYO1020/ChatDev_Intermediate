Task:
Define a function 'count_valid_subsequences(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input where 'N' is the number of integers and 'A' is the list of integers. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the list of integers 'A' from standard input. Initialize a variable 'count' to store the number of valid subsequences found, starting at 0. Use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of indices (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < N to check for valid subsequences. For each valid pair (i, j), increment the 'count' variable if 'A[i] <= A[j]'. Implement a method to calculate the number of ways to choose subsequences of length at least 2 from the valid pairs found. Ensure that the result is computed modulo '998244353' to handle large numbers. Return the final count of valid subsequences from the function 'count_valid_subsequences'. Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness, especially edge cases like minimum and maximum values of N and A. Output the result of the function call in the specified format.
