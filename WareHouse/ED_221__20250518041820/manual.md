# Subsequence Calculator

A Python application for counting valid subsequences based on given criteria.

## Quick Install

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Subsequence Calculator is designed to count the number of valid subsequences from a list of integers. A valid subsequence is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < N and A[i] <= A[j]. The application computes the number of ways to choose subsequences of length at least 2 from the valid pairs found, ensuring the result is computed modulo `998244353` to handle large numbers.

### Main Functions

- **count_valid_subsequences(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int**: 
  - This function takes an integer `N` (the number of integers) and a list `A` of integers as input. It returns the count of valid subsequences based on the defined criteria.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Input**: 
   - Create a text file or prepare standard input that contains the number of integers `N` on the first line, followed by the list of integers `A` on the second line. For example:
     ```
     5
     1 2 3 4 5
     ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - You can run the application from the command line. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```
   Replace `input.txt` with the path to your input file.

3. **Output**:
   - The application will output the count of valid subsequences in the following format:
   ```
   Valid Subsequences Count: <result>
   ```

## Testing

To ensure the correctness of the function, you can test it with various inputs, including edge cases like minimum and maximum values of `N` and `A`. 

### Example Test Cases

- **Example 1**:
  ```
  Input:
  5
  1 2 3 4 5
  Output:
  Valid Subsequences Count: 10
  ```

- **Example 2**:
  ```
  Input:
  3
  3 2 1
  Output:
  Valid Subsequences Count: 0
  ```
