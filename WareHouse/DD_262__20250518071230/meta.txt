Task:
Define a function 'count_integer_averages(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to handle the input parameters where N is the length of the sequence and A is the list of positive integers. Implement input handling to read the integer N and the list A from standard input. Calculate the total number of non-empty subsets of A, which is (2^N - 1). Iterate through all possible non-empty subsets of A using bit manipulation to generate subsets. For each subset, calculate the sum of its elements and the count of elements in the subset. Check if the average of the subset (sum/count) is an integer by verifying if sum % count == 0. Maintain a count of all subsets that have an integer-valued average. Apply modulo operation with 998244353 to the final count of subsets with integer averages. Return the final count from the function 'count_integer_averages'. Ensure the output format is an integer representing the count of subsets with integer averages.
