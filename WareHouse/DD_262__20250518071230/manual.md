# Integer Average Subset Calculator

This application calculates the count of non-empty subsets of a list of positive integers that have an integer average. It utilizes bit manipulation to efficiently generate and evaluate subsets.

## Main Functions

- **count_integer_averages(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int**: This function takes the length of the list `N` and the list of positive integers `A` as input. It calculates the total number of non-empty subsets of `A` that have an integer average and returns this count modulo 998244353.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # No external dependencies required for this application
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the data**:
   - When prompted, enter the length of the list (must be a positive integer).
   - Next, enter exactly `N` positive integers separated by spaces.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the length of the list (must be a positive integer): 3
   Please enter exactly 3 positive integers (space-separated):
   1 2 3
   ```

3. **View the result**:
   The application will calculate and display the count of subsets with integer averages.

   Example output:
   ```
   Count of subsets with integer averages: 7
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure that:
- The length of the list is a positive integer.
- The list contains exactly `N` positive integers.

If any input is invalid, the application will prompt the user to try again, providing appropriate error messages.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to calculate the count of subsets with integer averages from a list of positive integers. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
