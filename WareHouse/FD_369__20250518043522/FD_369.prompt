Define the function 'max_coins(H: int, W: int, N: int, coins: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the values of H, W, N, and the list of coin positions (R_i, C_i) from the input format. Initialize a grid representation to track the positions of the coins and the maximum coins that can be collected at each cell. Implement a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum number of coins that can be collected while moving from (1,1) to (H,W). Keep track of the path taken to achieve the maximum number of coins collected by storing previous positions during the dynamic programming calculation. Ensure that the movement is restricted to only down or right directions as specified in the problem statement. Handle edge cases where there are no coins or where the grid size is minimal. Return the maximum number of coins collected and the path taken as a list of tuples representing the coordinates. Implement input validation to ensure that all constraints are satisfied before processing the data. Format the output to display the maximum number of coins and the path in the specified output format.
