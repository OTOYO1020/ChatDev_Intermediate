# Path Counter

A simple application for counting distinct paths in a grid based on given integer values.

## Overview

The Path Counter application allows users to input a grid of integers and calculates the number of distinct paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. The paths can only move right or down, and each path must consist of distinct integer values.

## Main Functions

- **Input Grid Dimensions**: Users can specify the dimensions of the grid (H x W).
- **Populate Grid**: Users can input H rows of W integers to fill the grid.
- **Count Paths**: The application calculates the total number of valid paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid, ensuring that all integers in the path are distinct.

## Installation

To run the Path Counter application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Grid Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the dimensions of the grid (H and W) separated by a space. For example:
   ```
   3 3
   ```

3. **Input Grid Values**: Next, input H rows of W integers. Each row should contain exactly W integers. For example:
   ```
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   ```

4. **View Results**: After inputting the grid, the application will calculate and display the total number of distinct paths:
   ```
   Total Paths: X
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```
$ python main.py
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Total Paths: 2
```

## Error Handling

- If the dimensions of the grid are invalid (less than or equal to zero), the application will display an error message:
  ```
  Invalid grid dimensions. H and W must be greater than 0.
  ```

- If the input does not match the specified dimensions, the application will notify the user:
  ```
  Invalid input. Each row must contain exactly W integers.
  ```

- If the grid is empty or improperly populated, the application will indicate:
  ```
  Invalid grid. Ensure all rows have exactly W integers.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Path Counter application is a straightforward tool for counting distinct paths in a grid. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and utilize the software to explore various grid configurations and their corresponding path counts.
