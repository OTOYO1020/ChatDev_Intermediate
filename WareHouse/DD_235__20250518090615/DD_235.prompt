Define the function 'min_operations(a: int, N: int) -> int' to encapsulate the logic for calculating the minimum operations. Initialize a variable 'x' to 1, representing the initial number on the blackboard. Create a loop to perform operations until 'x' equals 'N' or no further operations can be performed. Implement the multiplication operation: update 'x' to 'x * a' and check if this new value is equal to 'N'. Implement the string manipulation operation: if 'x >= 10' and 'x' is not divisible by 10, convert 'x' to a string, move the last character to the front, and convert it back to an integer. Keep track of the number of operations performed in a variable 'operations_count'. If 'x' equals 'N', return 'operations_count' as the result. If no operations can lead to 'N', return -1. Ensure input constraints are checked: '2 <= a < 10^6' and '2 <= N < 10^6'. Format the output to return the minimum number of operations or -1 as specified.
