# Min Operations

Calculate the minimum operations to reach a target number using multiplication and string manipulation.

## Overview

The Min Operations application allows users to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the number 1 into a specified target number \( N \) using a multiplication factor \( a \) and a string manipulation technique. This application is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, leveraging a breadth-first search approach to explore possible operations.

## Main Functions

- **Multiplication Operation**: Multiply the current number \( x \) by \( a \).
- **String Manipulation Operation**: If \( x \) is greater than or equal to 10 and not divisible by 10, move the last digit of \( x \) to the front.
- **Operation Count**: Keep track of the number of operations performed to reach \( N \).
- **Input Validation**: Ensure that the inputs \( a \) and \( N \) fall within the specified constraints.

## Installation

To run the Min Operations application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install any required dependencies (if applicable). For this application, there are no external dependencies beyond Python's standard library.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter the values for \( a \) and \( N \):
   - \( a \): The multiplication factor (must be in the range \( 2 \leq a < 10^6 \)).
   - \( N \): The target number (must be in the range \( 2 \leq N < 10^6 \)).

3. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will calculate and display the minimum number of operations required to reach \( N \) from 1. If it is not possible to reach \( N \), the application will return -1.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter a (2 <= a < 10^6): 3
Enter N (2 <= N < 10^6): 30
Minimum operations: 3
```

In this example, the application indicates that it takes 3 operations to reach 30 from 1 using a multiplication factor of 3.

## Error Handling

- If the input values for \( a \) or \( N \) are out of bounds, the application will display an error message:
```plaintext
Input Error: Input values are out of bounds.
```

## Conclusion

The Min Operations application is a powerful tool for exploring mathematical transformations through operations. By following the instructions in this manual, users can easily set up and utilize the application to solve their specific problems.
