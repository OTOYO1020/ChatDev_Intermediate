# Giant Stacking Application

This application calculates the maximum height of the topmost giant when stacking giants based on their shoulder and head heights.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of giants and their respective shoulder and head heights from user input.
- **Height Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible height of the head of the topmost giant by evaluating all possible stacking permutations.
- **Output**: The application prints the maximum height achieved.

## Installation

To run the Giant Stacking Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure that you check the box to add Python to your PATH during installation.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install itertools
   ```

   Note: The `itertools` module is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required for it.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Giants**: When prompted, enter the number of giants (N). This should be a positive integer.

3. **Input Shoulder Heights**: Next, you will be prompted to enter the shoulder heights of the giants. Input the heights as space-separated integers.

   Example: 
   ```
   Enter the shoulder heights (space-separated): 5 3 4
   ```

4. **Input Head Heights**: After entering the shoulder heights, you will be prompted to enter the head heights of the giants. Again, input these as space-separated integers.

   Example:
   ```
   Enter the head heights (space-separated): 2 1 3
   ```

5. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and display the maximum height of the topmost giant.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Max Height: 10
   ```

## Error Handling

- If you enter a non-integer value for the number of giants or heights, the application will prompt you to enter valid integers.
- If the number of heights provided does not match the number of giants, an error message will be displayed.
- Negative heights are not allowed, and the application will prompt you to enter valid heights.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to calculate the maximum height of stacked giants based on their shoulder and head heights. For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact support.
