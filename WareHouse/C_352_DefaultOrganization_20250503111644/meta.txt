Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of giants. Read the arrays A and B, where A[i] represents the shoulder height and B[i] represents the head height of giant i. Initialize a variable 'max_height' to store the maximum possible height of the head of the topmost giant. Generate all permutations of the array [1, 2, ..., N] to represent the different stacking orders of the giants. For each permutation P:\n   - Initialize a variable 'current_height' to 0 to track the height of the shoulders of the current giant being placed.\n   - For i from 1 to N:\n     - Update 'current_height' with the shoulder height of the current giant: 'current_height += A[P[i-1]]'.\n     - Calculate the head height of the current giant and update 'max_height' if it exceeds the current maximum: 'max_height = max(max_height, current_height + B[P[i-1]])'. After evaluating all permutations, print the value of 'max_height' as the result.\n\nNote: Given the constraints, generating all permutations is computationally expensive. Consider optimizing this step using a greedy approach or dynamic programming if necessary.
