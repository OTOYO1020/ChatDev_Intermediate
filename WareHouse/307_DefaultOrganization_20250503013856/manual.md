# Palindrome Checker

A simple application to check for palindromic concatenations of distinct strings.

## Overview

The Palindrome Checker allows users to input a specified number of distinct strings and checks if any concatenation of two distinct strings forms a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Main Functions

- **Input Distinct Strings**: Users can input a specified number of distinct strings.
- **Palindrome Checking**: The application checks all possible concatenations of the input strings to determine if any of them form a palindrome.
- **Output**: The application will print "YES" if a palindrome is found and "NO" if none are found.

## Installation

To run the Palindrome Checker, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**: 
   Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not already present) and include any necessary dependencies. For this application, no external libraries are required beyond Python's standard library.

   If you want to specify a version of Python for clarity or future reference, you can modify it as follows:
   ```
   python==3.x.x  # Replace with your desired version
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Strings**:
   When prompted, enter the number of distinct strings you wish to input.

3. **Input Distinct Strings**:
   Enter each string when prompted. Ensure that each string is distinct; if a duplicate is entered, the application will prompt you to enter a different string.

4. **View Results**:
   After all strings have been entered, the application will check for palindromic concatenations. It will print "YES" if a palindrome is found and "NO" if none are found.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of distinct strings: 3
Enter string 1: hello
Enter string 2: olleh
Enter string 3: world
YES
```

In this example, the concatenation of "hello" and "olleh" forms a palindrome.
