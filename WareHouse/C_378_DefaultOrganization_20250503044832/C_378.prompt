Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the sequence. Read the sequence of positive integers A of length N from standard input. Initialize an empty dictionary 'last_seen' to keep track of the most recent positions of each number in A. Initialize an array B of length N with all values set to -1. Loop through each index 'i' from 0 to N-1 (corresponding to A_1 to A_N):\n   - Check if A[i] exists in 'last_seen'.\n   - If it exists, set B[i] to 'last_seen[A[i]]'.\n   - Update 'last_seen[A[i]]' to the current index 'i'. After completing the loop, B will contain the required positions. Print the array B as the output in the specified format.\n\n**Function to be used:**\n- The main function can be named 'find_recent_positions(N, A)' which will handle the logic described in the subtasks.\n\n**Output format:**\n- The output should be the sequence B printed as space-separated integers.
