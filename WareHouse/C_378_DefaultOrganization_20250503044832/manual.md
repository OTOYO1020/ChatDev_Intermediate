# Recent Positions Finder

A Python application designed to find the most recent positions of integers in a sequence.

## Overview

The Recent Positions Finder allows users to input a sequence of positive integers and retrieves the most recent positions of each integer in the sequence. This can be useful for various applications, including data analysis and tracking occurrences in datasets.

## Main Functions

1. **`find_recent_positions(N, A)`**: 
   - This function takes an integer `N` (the length of the sequence) and a list of integers `A` (the sequence itself).
   - It returns a list `B` where each element at index `i` contains the most recent position of `A[i]` in the sequence. If `A[i]` has not appeared before, `B[i]` will be `-1`.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Recent Positions Finder, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**: 
   Currently, there are no additional dependencies required for this application beyond Python itself.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Save the provided code into two files: `main.py` and `utils.py`.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.
   - Run the application using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - First, input the integer `N`, which represents the length of the sequence.
   - On the next line, input the sequence of positive integers separated by spaces.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   1 2 1 3 2
   ```

3. **Output Format**:
   - The application will output the sequence `B` as space-separated integers, where each integer represents the most recent position of the corresponding integer in the input sequence.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   -1 0 1 2 1
   ```

## Error Handling

- If `N` is not a positive integer, the application will print an error message:
  ```
  Error: N must be a positive integer.
  ```

- If the length of the sequence does not match `N` or if any number is not a positive integer, the application will print:
  ```
  Error: Please ensure the length of the sequence matches N and all numbers are positive integers.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Recent Positions Finder is a simple yet powerful tool for tracking the occurrences of integers in a sequence. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily utilize this application for their data processing needs.
