# Binary String Evaluator

A Python application to evaluate binary strings with wildcard characters ('?') and find the maximum decimal value less than or equal to a specified integer.

## Overview

This application allows users to input an integer \( N \) and a binary string \( S \) that may contain wildcard characters ('?'). The application evaluates all possible combinations of the string by replacing '?' with '0' or '1', converting the resulting binary strings to decimal integers, and determining the maximum value that does not exceed \( N \).

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer \( N \) and a binary string \( S \) from standard input.
- **Combination Evaluation**: Generates all possible combinations of the binary string by replacing '?' with '0' or '1'.
- **Decimal Conversion**: Converts the generated binary strings to decimal integers.
- **Maximum Value Calculation**: Determines the maximum decimal value that is less than or equal to \( N \).
- **Error Handling**: Validates input and handles exceptions gracefully.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not have external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python installed correctly.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Requirements**:
   - When prompted, enter an integer \( N \) (e.g., `10`).
   - Enter a binary string \( S \) that may contain '?' characters (e.g., `1?0?`).

3. **Output**: The application will output the maximum decimal value found that is less than or equal to \( N \). If no valid values are found, it will print `-1`.

### Example

- **Input**:
  ```
  Enter an integer N: 10
  Enter a binary string S (with '?'): 1?0?
  ```

- **Output**:
  ```
  10
  ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for invalid inputs. If the input string \( S \) contains characters other than '0', '1', or '?', or if \( N \) is not a valid integer, an error message will be displayed.

## Edge Cases

- If the string \( S \) contains no '?', the application will directly convert the binary string to decimal and check against \( N \).
- The application handles leading zeros in binary strings appropriately, skipping combinations that would result in invalid binary representations.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to evaluate binary strings with wildcards and find the maximum decimal value within specified constraints. For further enhancements or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
