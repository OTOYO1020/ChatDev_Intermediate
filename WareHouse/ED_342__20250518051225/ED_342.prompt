Define the function 'calculate_latest_arrival_times(N: int, M: int, train_info: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int]]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters. Parse the input to extract the number of stations 'N' and the number of train information pieces 'M'. Create a data structure to store the train schedules based on the provided tuples '(l_i, d_i, k_i, c_i, A_i, B_i)'. Implement a method to generate all departure times for each train based on the given information. Implement a search algorithm to find the latest time 't' for each station 'S' from '1' to 'N-1' using the train schedules. Ensure that the conditions for valid train transfers are checked during the search process, including arrival and departure times. Handle cases where no valid train sequence exists by setting 'f(S) = -âˆž' appropriately. Store the results of 'f(1), f(2), ..., f(N-1)' in a list to be returned. Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness and efficiency given the constraints. Format the output as a list of integers representing the latest arrival times for each station from '1' to 'N-1'.
