# Train Schedule Application

A Python application for calculating the latest arrival times for train schedules across multiple stations.

## Overview

This application allows users to input train schedules and determine the latest possible arrival times at each station. It is designed to handle complex train transfer scenarios and ensure that all conditions for valid transfers are met.

## Main Functions

- **calculate_latest_arrival_times(N: int, M: int, train_info: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int]]) -> List[int]**: 
  - This function takes the number of stations `N`, the number of train information pieces `M`, and a list of train schedules. It returns a list of integers representing the latest arrival times for each station from `1` to `N-1`.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you do not have a `requirements.txt`, ensure you have the following packages:
   - `typing` (for type hinting, if using Python < 3.9)

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your input**: Define the number of stations `N`, the number of train information pieces `M`, and the train information in the format of a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain:
   - `l_i`: Departure station
   - `d_i`: Departure time
   - `k_i`: Train number
   - `c_i`: Train type
   - `A_i`: Arrival time at the destination station
   - `B_i`: Arrival station

   Example input:
   ```python
   N = 4
   M = 5
   train_info = [
       (1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2),
       (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3),
       (2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4),
       (3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5),
       (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3)
   ]
   ```

2. **Run the application**: You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. This file contains the main entry point of the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View the results**: The application will output the latest arrival times for each station from `1` to `N-1`.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the application:

```python
from train_schedule import TrainSchedule
from typing import List, Tuple

def main(N: int, M: int, train_info: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    train_schedule = TrainSchedule(N, M, train_info)
    latest_arrival_times = train_schedule.calculate_latest_arrival_times()
    return latest_arrival_times

if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = 4
    M = 5
    train_info = [
        (1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2),
        (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3),
        (2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4),
        (3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5),
        (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3)
    ]
    result = main(N, M, train_info)
    print(result)  # Output: latest arrival times
```
