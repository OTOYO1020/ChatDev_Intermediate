Read the 9x9 grid \( A \) from standard input, ensuring that each cell contains an integer between 1 and 9. Verify that each row of \( A \) contains each integer from 1 to 9 exactly once:\n   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to 9, check if the set of values in that row equals the set \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}. Verify that each column of \( A \) contains each integer from 1 to 9 exactly once:\n   - For each column \( j \) from 1 to 9, check if the set of values in that column equals the set \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}. Divide the grid \( A \) into three groups of rows (each containing three rows) and three groups of columns (each containing three columns) to form 3x3 subgrids. For each 3x3 subgrid, verify that it contains each integer from 1 to 9 exactly once:\n   - For each group of rows \( (i, i+1, i+2) \) and columns \( (j, j+1, j+2) \), check if the set of values in that subgrid equals the set \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}. If all conditions from steps 2, 3, and 5 are satisfied, set the result to Yes; otherwise, set it to No. Print the result.\n\n### Function and Variable Names\n- Function to check rows: 'check_rows(A)'\n- Function to check columns: 'check_columns(A)'\n- Function to check subgrids: 'check_subgrids(A)'\n- Variable for result: 'result'\n\n### Input and Output Format\n- Input: A 9x9 grid \( A \) read from standard input.\n- Output: Print Yes if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise print No.
