Task:
Receive the string 'S' from standard input, ensuring it consists of lowercase English letters and parentheses. Initialize an empty set 'box' to keep track of the balls (lowercase letters) added. Loop through each character 'S[i]' in the string 'S' using an index 'i' from 1 to '|S|'. For each character:\n   - If 'S[i]' is a lowercase letter:\n     - Check if the letter is already in 'box'. If it is, print NO and terminate.\n     - Otherwise, add the letter to 'box'.\n   - If 'S[i]' is '(', do nothing and continue to the next character.\n   - If 'S[i]' is ')':\n     - Find the maximum integer 'j' less than 'i' such that the substring 'S[j:i]' forms a good string.\n     - Remove all balls from 'box' that were added in the operations from 'j' to 'i'. After processing all characters, if no fainting occurred, print YES.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that all operations are handled correctly and efficiently, adhering to the constraints provided.
