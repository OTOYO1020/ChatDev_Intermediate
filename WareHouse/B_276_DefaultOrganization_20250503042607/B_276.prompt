Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of cities and roads, respectively. Initialize an adjacency list 'connections' as a list of empty sets for each city to store directly connected cities. For each road (i from 1 to M), read the pair of integers (A_i, B_i) and update the 'connections' list:\n   - Add city B_i to the set of city A_i.\n   - Add city A_i to the set of city B_i. For each city i from 1 to N, do the following:\n   - Convert the set of directly connected cities in 'connections[i]' to a sorted list 'connected_cities'.\n   - Determine the number of directly connected cities 'd_i' as the length of 'connected_cities'. Prepare the output for each city i:\n   - Create a result string that includes 'd_i' followed by the sorted list of connected cities. Print each result string for cities 1 through N on a new line.\n\nOutput format:\n- Each line should contain 'd_i' followed by the city numbers of the directly connected cities in ascending order, separated by spaces.
