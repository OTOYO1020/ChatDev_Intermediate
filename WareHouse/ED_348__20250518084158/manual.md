# Tree Distance Application

This application is designed to efficiently calculate distances in a tree structure and find the optimal vertex based on a given sequence of integers. It utilizes advanced algorithms to ensure performance even with large trees.

## Main Functions

- **Input Parsing**: Reads the number of vertices, edges, and a sequence of integers from user input.
- **Tree Construction**: Builds a tree using an adjacency list representation based on the provided edges.
- **Distance Calculation**: Computes the distance between any two vertices using Depth First Search (DFS) and Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) techniques.
- **Function Calculation**: Calculates the function `f(x) = sum(C[i] * d(x, i))` for all vertices, where `C` is the sequence of integers and `d(x, i)` is the distance between vertices `x` and `i`.
- **Minimum Value Search**: Iterates through all vertices to find the minimum value of `f(v)` and the corresponding vertex `v`.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Hereâ€™s how to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   When prompted, enter the input data in the following format:
   ```
   N
   A1 B1
   A2 B2
   ...
   A(N-1) B(N-1)
   C1 C2 ... CN
   ```
   - `N`: Number of vertices in the tree.
   - `A_i B_i`: Pairs of integers representing edges between vertices.
   - `C`: A sequence of integers corresponding to each vertex.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   1 2
   1 3
   2 4
   2 5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```

3. **Output**:
   After processing the input, the application will output the minimum value of `f(v)` found and the corresponding vertex `v` that achieves this minimum, in the following format:
   ```
   Minimum f(v): <min_value> at vertex: <min_vertex>
   ```

## Testing and Edge Cases

The application has been designed to handle various edge cases, including:
- The smallest possible tree (N=1).
- The largest possible tree (N=100,000).
- Trees with varying structures (balanced, skewed, etc.).

Make sure to test the application with different inputs to ensure correctness and performance.

## Conclusion

This application provides a robust solution for calculating distances in tree structures and finding optimal vertices based on a sequence of integers. For further assistance or support, please reach out to the development team.
