Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of takoyaki. Initialize an array 'deliciousness' to store the deliciousness values of the N takoyaki. Read N integers from standard input and populate the 'deliciousness' array with these values. Initialize a variable 'total_health_points' to 0 to keep track of the cumulative health points restored. Use a nested loop to iterate through all unique pairs of takoyaki (i, j) where i < j:\n   - Calculate the health points restored from the pair as 'health_points = deliciousness[i] * deliciousness[j]'.\n   - Add 'health_points' to 'total_health_points'. After processing all pairs, print the value of 'total_health_points'.\n\nOutput format: The final output will be a single integer representing the total health points restored from all pairs of takoyaki.
