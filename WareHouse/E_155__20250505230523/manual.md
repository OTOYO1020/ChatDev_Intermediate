# Takoyaki Machine Payment Software

This software is designed to calculate the minimum number of banknotes required for making a payment and providing change when purchasing a Takoyaki machine. It efficiently handles very large integers, ensuring accurate calculations even for values up to \(10^{1,000,000}\).

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads a large integer value \(N\) from standard input, ensuring it is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{1,000,000}\).
- **Banknote Calculation**: Determines the smallest banknote value greater than or equal to \(N\) and calculates the total number of banknotes used by both the user and the clerk.
- **Change Calculation**: Computes the change to be returned and the number of banknotes required for that change.

## Installation

To run the Takoyaki Machine software, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. **No additional dependencies** are required for this software as it uses built-in Python functionalities.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code, clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Amount**: When prompted, enter the amount \(N\) you wish to pay for the Takoyaki machine. Ensure that the value is a positive integer and does not exceed \(10^{1,000,000}\).

4. **View the Output**: The software will calculate and display the total number of banknotes used for the payment and change.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the amount (N): 5000
Total Banknotes: 2
```

In this example, if you enter `5000`, the software will calculate the minimum number of banknotes needed for the payment and the change.

## Error Handling

- If the input is invalid (e.g., not a positive integer, exceeds the maximum limit, or starts with zero), the software will display an error message:
```plaintext
Error: N must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^1,000,000.
```

## Conclusion

The Takoyaki Machine Payment Software is a robust solution for handling large integer payments and change calculations. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, ensuring a smooth experience for users making purchases.
