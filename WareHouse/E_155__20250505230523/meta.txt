Task:
Read the integer value of N from standard input, ensuring it is between 1 and \(10^{1,000,000}\). Initialize a variable 'total_banknotes' to track the minimum number of banknotes used by both you and the clerk. Determine the smallest banknote value that is greater than or equal to N. This can be done by calculating the power of 10 that is closest to N. Calculate the number of banknotes you will use to pay for the takoyaki machine:\n   - If you pay exactly N, use 1 banknote.\n   - If you pay more than N, determine the next banknote value (10^k) that is greater than N and calculate the total banknotes used. Calculate the change that the clerk will give back, which is the amount you paid minus N. Determine the number of banknotes the clerk will use to give back the change:\n   - Use the same logic as in step 4 to find the minimum number of banknotes needed for the change. Sum the banknotes used by you and the clerk to get the 'total_banknotes'. Print the 'total_banknotes' as the final output. Ensure that all calculations handle large integers appropriately, given the constraints on N. Validate the output to ensure it meets the problem requirements.
