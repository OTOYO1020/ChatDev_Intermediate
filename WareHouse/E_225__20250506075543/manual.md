# Visibility Checker

A software application designed to determine the visibility of coordinates representing the number '7' from a specified origin point.

## Overview

The Visibility Checker allows users to input a number of coordinates and checks how many of these coordinates are wholly visible from the origin (0, 0). The software uses geometric algorithms to determine visibility based on the defined quadrilaterals formed by the coordinates.

## Main Functions

- **Input Coordinates**: Users can input multiple coordinates in the format `x,y`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
- **Visibility Check**: The application checks if each coordinate is visible from the origin by calculating intersections with other coordinates.
- **Output**: The software outputs the total count of visible coordinates.

## Installation

To run the Visibility Checker, you need to set up your environment with the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```

   Then install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Coordinates**:
   When prompted, enter the number of coordinates (N) you want to input.

3. **Input Coordinates**:
   For each coordinate, enter the values in the format `x,y`. Ensure that both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. If the input is invalid, you will be prompted to enter the coordinates again.

4. **View Results**:
   After entering all coordinates, the application will calculate and display the number of visible '7's from the origin.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of 7's: 3
Enter coordinates in the format x,y (e.g., 3,4): 1,2
Enter coordinates in the format x,y (e.g., 3,4): 2,3
Enter coordinates in the format x,y (e.g., 3,4): 3,1
Visible 7's: 2
```

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding libraries such as `numpy` or `scipy` for enhanced numerical computations or geometric operations. You can include them in the `requirements.txt` file as needed.

## Support

For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team or consult the documentation for further assistance.
