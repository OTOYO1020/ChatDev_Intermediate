Task:
Read integers N and Q from standard input, representing the number of roadworks and the number of people, respectively. Initialize a list 'roadworks' to store tuples of (X_i, S_i, T_i) for each roadwork. For each roadwork from 1 to N, read the values X_i, S_i, and T_i and append them to the 'roadworks' list. Read the starting times D_i for each person from standard input and store them in a list 'people'. Sort the 'roadworks' list based on the coordinate X_i to facilitate efficient searching. For each person in 'people', determine the maximum distance they can walk before reaching a blocked point:\n   - For each person, find the first roadwork that blocks their path after their starting time D_i.\n   - If a roadwork exists that blocks their path, calculate the distance they can walk before being blocked. Store the results in a list 'distances', where each entry corresponds to the distance walked by each person. Print the distances for each person in the order they were provided.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to be implemented: 'calculate_distances(roadworks, people)'\n- Variables: 'roadworks', 'people', 'distances', 'D_i', 'X_i', 'S_i', 'T_i'
