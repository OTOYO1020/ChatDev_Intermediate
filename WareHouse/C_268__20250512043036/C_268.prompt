Define the function 'max_happy_people(N: int, dishes: List[int]) -> int' to encapsulate the main logic of the problem. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the list of dishes 'p' from the input format. Implement a mechanism to rotate the turntable and update the positions of the dishes accordingly. Create a helper function to check if a person is happy based on the current dish positions and their index. Iterate through all possible rotations of the turntable and count the number of happy people for each configuration. Keep track of the maximum number of happy people encountered during the iterations. Ensure that the constraints are respected, particularly that '3 <= N <= 200000' and '0 <= p_i <= N-1'. Implement a check to ensure that all dish values are unique as per the problem constraints. Return the maximum number of happy people found after evaluating all rotations. Format the output as an integer representing the maximum number of happy people.
