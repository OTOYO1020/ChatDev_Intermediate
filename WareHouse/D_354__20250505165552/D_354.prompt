Read integers A, B, C, and D from standard input. Define a function 'is_black_region(x, y)' to determine if a given point (x, y) is in a black region based on the wallpaper pattern rules. Initialize a variable 'black_area' to 0 to keep track of the area of black regions within the rectangle. Loop through all integer coordinates (x, y) within the rectangle defined by the corners (A, B) and (C, D):\n   - For each x from A to C-1 and each y from B to D-1:\n     - Call 'is_black_region(x, y)' to check if the point is black.\n     - If it is black, increment 'black_area' by 1. Calculate the final result as 'result = 2 * black_area'. Print the value of 'result'.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that the problem is tackled step-by-step, focusing on input handling, logic implementation, and output generation.
