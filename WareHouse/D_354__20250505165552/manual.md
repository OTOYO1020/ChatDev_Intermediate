# Black Region Area Calculator

A Python application for calculating the area of black regions based on specified wallpaper pattern rules.

## Overview

This software reads integer coordinates from the user, defines a function to determine if a point lies within a black region, and calculates the area of these regions within a defined rectangle. The result is printed as twice the area of the black regions.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers A, B, C, and D from standard input to define the rectangle.
- **Black Region Determination**: The function `is_black_region(x, y)` checks if a point (x, y) is in a black region based on specific rules.
- **Area Calculation**: Loops through all integer coordinates within the rectangle and counts the number of black points, doubling the count for the final result.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Coordinates**: When prompted, enter four integers A, B, C, and D, separated by spaces. These integers define the corners of the rectangle.

   Example input:
   ```
   1 1 4 4
   ```

3. **View Result**: The application will output the area of the black regions calculated based on the defined rules.

   Example output:
   ```
   Black Area: 6
   ```

## Example of `is_black_region` Logic

The current implementation of `is_black_region(x, y)` checks if the sum of the coordinates is even. This is a placeholder logic and can be modified to fit the actual wallpaper pattern rules as per customer specifications.

```python
def is_black_region(x, y):
    return (x + y) % 2 == 0  # Modify this logic as needed
```

## Error Handling

- If the rectangle dimensions are invalid (i.e., A >= C or B >= D), the application will print an error message and terminate.
- If the input is not valid integers, the application will prompt the user to enter valid integers.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to calculate the area of black regions defined by user-specified coordinates and rules. For further customization or enhancements, feel free to modify the `is_black_region` function according to your needs.
