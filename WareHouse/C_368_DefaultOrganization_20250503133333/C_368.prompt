Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of enemies. Read the array H of integers, which contains the health values H_i for each enemy. Initialize a variable T to 0, which will track the number of turns taken. While there are enemies with health greater than 0:\n   - Increment T by 1.\n   - Check if the frontmost enemy (H[0]) has health greater than or equal to 1:\n     - If T is a multiple of 3, decrease H[0] by 3.\n     - Otherwise, decrease H[0] by 1. If the frontmost enemy's health drops to 0 or less, remove that enemy from the list. Repeat step 4 until all enemies have health of 0 or less. Print the final value of T, which represents the total number of turns taken to defeat all enemies.
