Read integers R and C from standard input, ensuring they are within the range of 1 to 15. Define a 15x15 grid representing the colors of the cells, where each cell's color is determined by its row and column indices. Access the cell located at the (R-1)th row and (C-1)th column of the grid to account for zero-based indexing. Store the color of the accessed cell in a variable named 'cell_color'. Print the value of 'cell_color' as the output.
