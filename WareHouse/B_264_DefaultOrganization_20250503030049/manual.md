# Cell Color Viewer

A simple application to view the color of a cell in a 15x15 grid based on user-defined row and column indices.

## Introduction

The Cell Color Viewer allows users to input row and column numbers to access a specific cell in a 15x15 grid. Each cell's color is determined by its row and column indices, providing a unique color for each cell based on a predefined list of colors. This application is designed to be user-friendly and ensures that inputs are validated to fall within the acceptable range.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: The application prompts the user to enter valid integers for row and column, ensuring they are between 1 and 15.
- **Grid Creation**: A 15x15 grid is created where each cell's color is determined by the sum of its row and column indices.
- **Color Retrieval**: The application retrieves and displays the color of the specified cell based on user input.

## Installation

To run the Cell Color Viewer, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies (not required for this specific application), you can install them using pip. For this application, no external libraries are required.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the Cell Color Viewer.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Row and Column**: When prompted, enter the row and column numbers (between 1 and 15). For example:
   ```
   Enter Row (1-15): 5
   Enter Column (1-15): 3
   ```

3. **View the Cell Color**: After entering valid inputs, the application will display the color of the specified cell. For example:
   ```
   Cell Color: blue
   ```

4. **Repeat**: You can run the application again to check the color of different cells by following the same steps.

## Example Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the following:
   ```
   Enter Row (1-15): 10
   Enter Column (1-15): 7
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   Cell Color: pink
   ```

## Conclusion

The Cell Color Viewer is a straightforward application that demonstrates basic input handling and grid manipulation in Python. It serves as a great starting point for users interested in understanding how to work with arrays and user input in programming.
