## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**‚ùì Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**ü§ñ Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha
