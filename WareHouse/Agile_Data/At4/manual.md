# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

To install the LangChain library, you can use either pip or conda.

Using pip:
```
pip install langchain
```

Using conda:
```
conda install langchain -c conda-forge
```

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**‚ùì Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**ü§ñ Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## üìñ Documentation

Please see the [full documentation](https://python.langchain.com) for detailed information on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

```

As the Chief Product Officer, I would also suggest creating a README.md file that provides a brief overview of the project, its purpose, and how to get started. This will help users quickly understand the project and its capabilities.

## Features

- Question Answering over specific documents
- Agents for combining LLMs with other services (e.g., GPT+WolframAlpha)

## Installation

To install LangChain, use pip:

```
pip install langchain
```

or conda:

```
conda install langchain -c conda-forge
```

## Getting Started

To get started with LangChain, please refer to the [documentation](https://python.langchain.com) for detailed instructions and examples.
