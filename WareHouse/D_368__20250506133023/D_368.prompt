Read integers N and K from standard input. Read N-1 edges (A_i, B_i) and store them in an adjacency list 'graph'. Read K specified vertices (V_1, V_2, ..., V_K) into a list 'required_vertices'. Implement a function 'dfs(node, parent)' to perform a depth-first search to find the minimum subtree. In 'dfs', for each vertex, check if it is in 'required_vertices':\n   - If it is, count it as part of the subtree.\n   - Recursively call 'dfs' for all adjacent vertices that are not the parent. Maintain a count of the vertices included in the subtree for each call of 'dfs'. Return the total count of vertices needed to include all specified vertices. Call 'dfs' starting from any vertex in 'required_vertices' (e.g., 'dfs(required_vertices[0], -1)'). Store the result from 'dfs' as 'min_vertices'. Print the value of 'min_vertices' as the final output.
