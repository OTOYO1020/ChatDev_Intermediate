Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of products. Initialize a list 'products' to store tuples of (T_i, D_i) for each product. For each product from 1 to N, read the values T_i and D_i from standard input and append them to the 'products' list. Sort the 'products' list based on the entry time T_i to facilitate optimal printing order. Initialize a variable 'last_print_time' to track the last time the printer was used. Initialize a counter 'max_printed' to count the maximum number of products printed. Iterate through the sorted 'products' list:\n   - For each product (T_i, D_i), check if the printer can print on it:\n     - If T_i >= last_print_time + 1, print on the product, update 'last_print_time' to D_i, and increment 'max_printed'. After processing all products, the value of 'max_printed' will represent the maximum number of products that can be printed. Print the value of 'max_printed' as the final output.
