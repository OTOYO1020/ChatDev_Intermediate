2. **Input Data**: 
   - The application will prompt you to enter the number of products. Input a positive integer.
   - For each product, input the entry time and duration in the format `T_i D_i`, separated by a space. Ensure both values are non-negative integers.

3. **View Results**: After processing the input, the application will output the maximum number of products that can be printed.

## Example

```
Enter the number of products to print: 3
Enter entry time and duration for product (T_i D_i): 1 2
Enter entry time and duration for product (T_i D_i): 2 3
Enter entry time and duration for product (T_i D_i): 4 1
Maximum products printed: 2
```
