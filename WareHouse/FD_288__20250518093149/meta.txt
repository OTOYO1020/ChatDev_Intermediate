Task:
Define the function 'calculate_sum_of_products(X: str, N: int) -> int' to handle the main logic of the problem. Parse the input to extract the integer 'X' and its digit count 'N' from the input format. Ensure that 'X' is a string of length 'N' and contains no '0' digits. Generate all possible subsets 'S' of the set '{1, 2, ..., N-1}'. For each subset 'S', split the string 'X' into '|S| + 1' parts based on the indices in 'S'. Convert each of the split parts into integers and calculate the product for the subset 'f(S)'. Accumulate the sum of all 'f(S)' values computed for each subset 'S'. Apply modulo '998244353' to the accumulated sum to ensure it fits within the required output constraints. Return the final result from the function 'calculate_sum_of_products'. Output the result in the specified format.
