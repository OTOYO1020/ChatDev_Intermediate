# Sum of Products Calculator

A Python application designed to calculate the sum of products of subsets derived from a given string of digits. This application allows users to input a string of digits and its length, ensuring that the string contains no '0' digits. The application then computes the sum of products based on the specified logic.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Accepts a string `X` of digits and its length `N`.
- **Validation**: Ensures that `X` is of length `N` and contains no '0' digits.
- **Subset Generation**: Generates all possible subsets of indices from the set `{1, 2, ..., N-1}`.
- **Product Calculation**: Splits the string `X` based on the generated subsets and calculates the product of the resulting parts.
- **Summation**: Accumulates the sum of all products and applies modulo `998244353` to ensure the result fits within the required output constraints.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly interface for input and output.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   You can install the required dependencies using pip. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can manually install the necessary packages (if any) using:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

## How to Use the Application

### Running the Application

1. **From Command Line**:
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the application using:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Using the GUI**:
   - The GUI will prompt you to enter the string `X` and its length `N`.
   - Input the values and click the "Calculate" button to get the result displayed on the screen.

### Input Format

- **X**: A string of digits (e.g., "12345").
- **N**: An integer representing the length of `X` (e.g., 5).

### Example Usage

1. When prompted, enter:
   ```
   Enter X (string of digits): 12345
   Enter N (length of X): 5
   ```
2. Click the "Calculate" button.
3. The result will be displayed below the input fields.

### Error Handling

- If the input does not meet the criteria (e.g., `X` contains '0' digits or the length of `X` does not match `N`), an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Sum of Products Calculator is a powerful tool for calculating products based on subsets of a string of digits. With its simple interface and robust functionality, users can easily perform complex calculations with minimal effort.
