Read integers N, M, and K from standard input. Initialize a list of conditions, each represented as a tuple (A_i, B_i), by reading M pairs of integers. Initialize a list of actions, each represented as a tuple (C_i, D_i), by reading K pairs of integers. Create a function 'count_satisfied_conditions(conditions, actions)' to evaluate how many conditions can be satisfied based on the actions taken. In 'count_satisfied_conditions', create a set to track which dishes have balls on them. For each action (C_i, D_i) in actions, add balls to the respective dishes. For each condition (A_i, B_i) in conditions, check if both dishes have at least one ball. Count the number of satisfied conditions and return this count. Call 'count_satisfied_conditions(conditions, actions)' and store the result. Print the final count of satisfied conditions.
