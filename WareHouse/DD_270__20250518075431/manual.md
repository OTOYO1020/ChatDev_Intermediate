```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Stone Game is a two-player game where players take turns removing stones from a pile. The players can only remove a certain number of stones based on the options provided. The goal for Takahashi is to maximize the number of stones he can remove during his turns.

### Main Functions

1. **max_stones_removed(N: int, K: int, A: List[int]) -> int**
   - This function calculates the maximum number of stones Takahashi can remove from the pile.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `N`: The total number of stones in the pile.
     - `K`: The number of unique options available for stone removal.
     - `A`: A list of unique integers representing the options for stone removal.
   - **Returns:** The total number of stones removed by Takahashi.

2. **Input Handling**

   - It ensures that the list `A` is sorted and contains unique values.

3. **Game Logic**
