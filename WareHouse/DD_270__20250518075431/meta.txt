Task:
Define a function 'max_stones_removed(N: int, K: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to calculate the maximum stones Takahashi can remove. Implement input handling to read integers N and K, and a list A of size K from standard input. Ensure that the list A is sorted in increasing order and contains unique values, as per the constraints. Implement the game logic where Takahashi and Aoki alternately choose stones from the pile based on the available options in A. Create a loop that continues until there are no stones left in the pile, alternating turns between Takahashi and Aoki. On Takahashi's turn, select the maximum possible value from A that does not exceed the current number of stones in the pile. On Aoki's turn, also select the maximum possible value from A that does not exceed the current number of stones in the pile. Keep track of the total stones removed by Takahashi during his turns. Return the total number of stones removed by Takahashi as the output of the function. Print the output in the required format after calling the function with the input values.
