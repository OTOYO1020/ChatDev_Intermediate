# LexicoSorter

A simple application to sort strings in lexicographical order.

## Introduction

LexicoSorter is a Python application designed to take an input string, validate its length, and return the lexicographically smallest permutation of that string. This application is useful for anyone needing to sort characters in a string for various applications, such as data processing, text analysis, or simply for educational purposes.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures the input string is between 1 and 200,000 characters.
- **Character Sorting**: Converts the string into a list of characters, sorts them in lexicographical order, and joins them back into a string.
- **Output**: Prints the sorted string to the console.

## Installation
