Receive the input string 'S' from standard input. Validate the length of 'S' to ensure it is between 1 and 200,000 characters. Convert the string 'S' into a list of characters for manipulation. Sort the list of characters to arrange them in lexicographical order. Join the sorted list of characters back into a string 'S''. Return the resulting string 'S'' as the lexicographically smallest permutation of 'S'. Print the output string 'S''.
