Task:
Define a function named 'count_students_with_min_height' that takes two parameters: a list of integers 'A' representing the heights of the students and an integer 'Q' representing the number of queries. Implement input handling to read the integer 'N' and the list 'A' of size 'N' from standard input. Implement input handling to read the integer 'Q' and the list of queries 'x' of size 'Q' from standard input. Sort the list 'A' to facilitate efficient querying of heights. For each query 'x_j' in the list of queries, use binary search to determine the number of students with height at least 'x_j'. Store the results of each query in a list named 'results'. Implement a function to output the results in the required format, one result per line. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when no students meet the height requirement. Optimize the solution to ensure it runs efficiently within the given constraints of up to 200,000 students and queries. Return the output from the function in the specified format after processing all queries.
