# Student Height Counter

A Python application for counting students based on height queries.

## Overview

The Student Height Counter is designed to efficiently handle queries regarding the number of students with heights above a specified minimum. It utilizes binary search for fast query resolution, making it suitable for large datasets of students and queries.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of students and their heights, as well as the number of queries and the queries themselves from standard input.
- **Height Counting**: For each query, it counts the number of students whose heights meet or exceed the specified value.
- **Output**: Displays the results of each query, one per line.

## Installation

To run the Student Height Counter, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application requires the following Python module:

- `bisect`: This module is included in the Python Standard Library, so no additional installation is necessary.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application using Python. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - First line: An integer `N` representing the number of students.
   - Second line: A space-separated list of `N` integers representing the heights of the students.
   - Third line: An integer `Q` representing the number of queries.
   - Fourth line: A space-separated list of `Q` integers representing the height queries.

   **Example Input:**
   ```
   5
   150 160 170 180 190
   3
   160 175 200
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will output the number of students meeting each height requirement, one result per line.

   **Example Output:**
   ```
   4
   3
   0
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for input validation. It will raise errors for:
- Negative numbers for the number of students or queries.
- Mismatched heights or queries count.
- Negative heights or queries.

## Conclusion

The Student Height Counter is a powerful tool for quickly assessing student heights against various queries. With its efficient design and straightforward usage, it can handle large datasets effectively.
