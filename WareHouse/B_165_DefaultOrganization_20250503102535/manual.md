# Takahashi Balance Application

A simple application to calculate the number of years required for Takahashi's initial deposit to reach a specified target balance.

## Overview

The Takahashi Balance Application allows users to input a target balance and calculates how many years it will take for an initial deposit of 100 to reach or exceed that balance. The balance grows at a rate of 1% per year.

## Main Functions

- **Input Target Balance**: The user is prompted to enter a target balance (X).
- **Calculate Years**: The application calculates the number of years required for the balance to reach or exceed the target.
- **Output Result**: The application outputs the number of years needed.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Balance Application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not already present) with the following content:
   ```
   # No current dependencies, but space for future additions
   ```

   Then, install any required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   Run the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Input the Target Balance**:
   When prompted, enter an integer value for the target balance (X). Ensure that the value is at least 100, as the initial balance is set to 100.

3. **View the Result**:
   After entering the target balance, the application will calculate and display the number of years required for the balance to reach or exceed the target.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the target balance: 200
2
```

In this example, it takes 2 years for the initial balance of 100 to reach or exceed the target balance of 200.

## Error Handling

- If the input is not a valid integer or is less than 100, the application will display an error message and exit.
- If the target balance is unreachable due to the growth rate, a runtime error will be raised.

## Future Enhancements

This application is designed to be simple and efficient. Future enhancements may include:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Additional features to simulate different growth rates or initial balances.
- Exporting results to a file for record-keeping.
