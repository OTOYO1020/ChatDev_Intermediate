Task:
Read the integer value X from standard input, which represents the target balance. Initialize a variable 'balance' to 100 to represent Takahashi's initial deposit. Initialize a variable 'years' to 0 to count the number of years until the balance reaches or exceeds X. Create a loop that continues until 'balance' is greater than or equal to X:\n   - Increment 'years' by 1.\n   - Calculate the new balance using the formula: 'balance = balance + (balance // 100)'. Exit the loop once the balance is equal to or exceeds X. Print the value of 'years' as the output.\n\nThis breakdown captures the essential steps needed to implement the solution to the problem statement.
