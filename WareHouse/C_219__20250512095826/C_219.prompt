Define a function 'sort_names(new_order: str, names: List[str]) -> List[str]' to handle the sorting of names based on the new alphabetical order. Parse the input to extract the string 'X' representing the new alphabetical order and the list of names 'S' from the input format. Validate that the string 'X' is a valid permutation of the lowercase English letters 'a' to 'z'. Create a mapping of each character in 'X' to its index to facilitate quick comparisons during sorting. Implement a custom comparison function that uses the mapping to compare two names lexicographically according to the new order. Sort the list of names 'S' using the custom comparison function. Ensure that the sorting algorithm can handle the maximum constraints efficiently, given that N can be up to 50000. Return the sorted list of names from the function 'sort_names'. Format the output to match the required output format, which is a list of sorted names. Print the sorted names as the final output.
