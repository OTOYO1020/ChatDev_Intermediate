Task:
Define the function 'minimum_attacks(N: int, K: int, H: List[int]) -> int' to calculate the minimum number of attacks needed. Parse the input to extract the values of N, K, and the list H of monster healths. Implement logic to determine the number of monsters that can be defeated using the Special Move, considering the maximum K allowed. Sort the list H in descending order to prioritize using Special Moves on the monsters with the highest health. Calculate the total health of the remaining monsters after applying the Special Moves. Determine the number of Attack actions required to reduce the remaining health to zero. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when K is zero or when all monsters have health less than or equal to K. Return the total number of Attack actions needed as the output of the function. Implement input reading from standard input and output the result using the defined function. Test the function with various test cases to validate correctness and performance.
