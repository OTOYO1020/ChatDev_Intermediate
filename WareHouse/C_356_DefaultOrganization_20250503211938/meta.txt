Task:
Read integers N, M, and K from standard input. Initialize a list to store the test results, which includes tuples of (C_i, list of keys A_{i,j}, R_i). For each test from 1 to M:\n   - Read C_i and the corresponding keys A_{i,1}, A_{i,2}, ..., A_{i,C_i}.\n   - Read the result R_i (either 'o' or 'x').\n   - Store the test data in the initialized list. Generate all possible combinations of keys being real or dummy (total of 2^N combinations). For each combination:\n   - Check each test result:\n     - If R_i is 'o', verify that at least K keys in the combination are real.\n     - If R_i is 'x', ensure that fewer than K keys are real. Count the number of valid combinations that satisfy all test results. If no valid combinations exist, return 0; otherwise, return the count of valid combinations. Print the final count of valid combinations.
