# Test Combination Application

A Python application designed to evaluate combinations of keys based on test results.

## Overview

The Test Combination application allows users to input a set of keys and their corresponding test results. The application then generates all possible combinations of these keys being either real or dummy and counts the number of valid combinations that satisfy the specified test conditions.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers N (total keys), M (number of tests), and K (minimum real keys required for a positive result).
- **Test Data Storage**: Collects test results in the form of tuples, including the number of keys, the list of keys, and the result ('o' for at least K real keys, 'x' for fewer than K real keys).
- **Combination Generation**: Utilizes the `itertools.product` to generate all possible combinations of keys being real (1) or dummy (0).
- **Validation**: Checks each combination against the test results to count valid configurations.
- **Output**: Prints the total count of valid combinations.

## Installation

To run the Test Combination application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install itertools
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input from standard input. You can provide the input in the following format:
   - First line: Three integers N, M, and K separated by spaces.
   - Next M lines: Each line should contain:
     - An integer C (number of keys for the test).
     - A line with C space-separated integers representing the keys.
     - A line with the result ('o' or 'x').

   Example Input:
   ```
   5 3 2
   3
   0 1 2
   o
   2
   1 3
   x
   2
   0 4
   o
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal. You can redirect input from a file or type it directly.

```bash
python main.py < input.txt
```

3. **View Output**: The application will print the count of valid combinations based on the provided test results.

## Example

Given the input:
```
5 3 2
3
0 1 2
o
2
1 3
x
2
0 4
o
```

The output might look like:
```
Valid combinations count: 8
```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation to ensure:
- N and M are positive integers, and K is non-negative.
- M does not exceed N.
- Each test has a valid number of keys and results.
- Keys are unique and within the valid range.

If any validation fails, a descriptive error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Test Combination application is a powerful tool for evaluating combinations of keys based on specified test conditions. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can effectively utilize the application for their testing needs.
