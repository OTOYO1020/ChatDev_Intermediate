Task:
Read the integers X, Y, Z from standard input, which represent the time costs for pressing the 'a' key, pressing 'a' with Shift, and pressing the Caps Lock key, respectively. Read the string S from standard input, which consists of characters 'A' and 'a'. Initialize a variable 'total_time' to 0 to keep track of the total milliseconds spent. Initialize a variable 'caps_lock_on' to 'False' to represent the state of the Caps Lock key. Loop through each character in the string S:\n   - If the character is 'a':\n     - If 'caps_lock_on' is 'True', add the cost Y to 'total_time' (press 'a' with Shift).\n     - If 'caps_lock_on' is 'False', add the cost X to 'total_time' (press 'a').\n   - If the character is 'A':\n     - If 'caps_lock_on' is 'False', add the cost Y to 'total_time' (press 'a' with Shift).\n     - If 'caps_lock_on' is 'True', add the cost X to 'total_time' (press 'a').\n     - If 'caps_lock_on' is 'False', add the cost Z to 'total_time' (press Caps Lock) and set 'caps_lock_on' to 'True'. After processing each character, check if 'caps_lock_on' is 'True':\n   - If it is, add the cost Z to 'total_time' (press Caps Lock to turn it off). Print the final value of 'total_time', which represents the minimum milliseconds needed to make the string on the screen equal to S.
