# Key Press Time Calculator

A simple application to calculate the total time spent pressing keys based on user-defined costs for different key presses.

## Introduction

This application reads the time costs for pressing the 'a' key, pressing 'a' with Shift, and pressing the Caps Lock key. It then calculates the total time required to type a given string consisting of 'A' and 'a' characters. The application is designed to help users understand the time implications of different key presses based on their preferences.

## Main Functions

- **Calculate Total Time**: The core function of the application calculates the total time based on the input costs and the string provided.
- **Input Handling**: The application reads input directly from the standard input, making it easy to integrate into various workflows.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. If you have the code in a single file, ensure you have it saved as `main.py`.

2. **Open a Terminal**: Navigate to the directory where your `main.py` file is located.

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Input Format**: The application expects the following input format:
   - The first line should contain three integers separated by spaces: `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, which represent the time costs for pressing the 'a' key, pressing 'a' with Shift, and pressing the Caps Lock key, respectively.
   - The second line should contain the string `S`, which consists of characters 'A' and 'a'.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   10 20 30
   AaAaA
   ```

5. **Output**: After entering the input, the application will calculate and print the total time in milliseconds required to type the string.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter the costs and the string:
   ```
   10 20 30
   AaAaA
   ```

3. The output will be:
   ```
   100
   ```

This indicates that it takes 100 milliseconds to type the string `AaAaA` with the given costs.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to calculate the time required for typing based on user-defined key press costs. It can be useful for understanding typing efficiency and optimizing keyboard usage.
