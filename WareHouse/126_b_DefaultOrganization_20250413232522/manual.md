# Numeric String Conversion Application

This application is designed to convert a 4-digit numeric string into a specific format based on the values of its first two and last two characters. It provides a simple interface for users to input their numeric strings and receive formatted outputs based on predefined rules.

## Main Functions

The main functionalities of the application include:

1. **Input Handling**: Accepts a 4-digit numeric string from the user.
2. **String Splitting**: Divides the input string into two parts: the first two characters (former) and the last two characters (latter).
3. **Conversion Logic**: Evaluates the numeric values of the two parts and returns:
   - `AMBIGUOUS` if both parts are between 1 and 12 inclusive.
   - `NA` if neither part is valid (not between 1 and 12).
   - `MMYY` if only the first part is valid.
   - `YYMM` if only the second part is valid.

## Installation Instructions

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (if you plan to add dependencies in the future):
   ```
   # Add any future dependencies here
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Input a Numeric String**:
   When prompted, enter a 4-digit numeric string (e.g., `1234`).

2. **Receive Output**:
   Based on the input, the application will process the string and output one of the following:
   - `AMBIGUOUS` if both parts are valid.
   - `NA` if neither part is valid.
   - `MMYY` if only the first part is valid.
   - `YYMM` if only the second part is valid.

### Example Usage

- **Input**: `1205`
  - **Output**: `AMBIGUOUS` (both `12` and `05` are valid)
  
- **Input**: `0000`
  - **Output**: `NA` (both parts are invalid)

- **Input**: `0304`
  - **Output**: `03MMYY` (only the first part is valid)

- **Input**: `1314`
  - **Output**: `NA` (both parts are invalid)

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to convert numeric strings based on specific rules. It is designed for ease of use and can be extended in the future to include additional functionalities or dependencies as needed.
