The highest priority comment is that the GUI class is missing the initialization of the diceTower object. This means that when the roll button is clicked, the diceTower object is not being used to roll the dice and update the result text area. To fix this, you need to add the following line of code in the actionPerformed method of the RollButtonListener class:
int result = diceTower.rollDice();
This will ensure that the diceTower object is used to roll the dice and update the result text area with the correct result.
Additionally, it would be helpful to add comments to the rollDice method in the DiceTower class to explain its functionality.
Please make these revisions to ensure that the dice rolling functionality works correctly in the GUI.
