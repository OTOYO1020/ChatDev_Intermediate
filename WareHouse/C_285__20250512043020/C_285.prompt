Define a function 'find_problem_index(S: str) -> int' that takes a string 'S' as input, representing the ID of a problem. Implement a method to calculate the total number of problem IDs with lengths less than that of 'S'. For each length from 1 to len(S)-1, compute the number of combinations of uppercase English letters (26) raised to the power of the current length. Sum the results from subtask 3 to get the cumulative count of all problem IDs shorter than 'S'. Implement a method to calculate the index of the problem ID 'S' among the IDs of the same length. For each character in 'S', determine its position in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25) and calculate the contribution to the index based on its position and the length of the string. Combine the results from subtasks 4 and 6 to get the final index of the problem ID 'S'. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as the smallest and largest possible values of 'S'. Test the function with various inputs to ensure correctness and performance, especially for large values of 'S'. Return the final index as output in the format of an integer.
