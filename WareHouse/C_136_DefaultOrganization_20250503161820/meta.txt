Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of squares. Read the array of integers H containing the heights of the squares, where H[i] represents the height of the i-th square. Initialize a variable 'previous_height' to track the height of the last square processed, starting with a value greater than the maximum possible height (e.g., 'previous_height = 10^9 + 1'). Iterate through each height in the array H:\n   - For each height H[i], check if it is greater than 'previous_height'.\n     - If H[i] > 'previous_height', check if H[i] - 1 is still greater than or equal to 'previous_height':\n       - If true, set 'previous_height' to H[i] - 1 (decrease the height).\n       - If false, set 'previous_height' to H[i] (do nothing).\n     - If H[i] <= 'previous_height', set 'previous_height' to H[i] (do nothing). If the loop completes without any issues, it is possible to achieve a non-decreasing order; otherwise, it is not. Print YES if it is possible to perform the operations to achieve non-decreasing heights, otherwise print NO. \n\nThis breakdown ensures that we handle the input correctly, process the heights according to the rules, and produce the required output format.
