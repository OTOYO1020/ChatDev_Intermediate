# Height Checking Application

This application checks if it is possible to achieve non-decreasing heights for a series of squares based on specific rules. It reads an integer representing the number of squares and an array of integers representing the heights of those squares.

## Main Functions

- **check_heights(n, heights)**: This function takes the number of squares and their respective heights as input and determines if it is possible to adjust the heights to achieve a non-decreasing order. It returns "YES" if possible, otherwise it returns "NO" with an appropriate error message.

## Installation Instructions

To run the height checking application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv height-checking-env
   source height-checking-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `height-checking-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Since this application does not have any external dependencies, you can skip this step. However, if you want to create an empty `requirements.txt`, you can do so:
   ```bash
   touch requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: 
   Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - First, enter an integer `N` which represents the number of squares.
   - On the next line, enter `N` space-separated integers representing the heights of the squares.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   3 1 4 1 5
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - The application will print "YES" if it is possible to adjust the heights to achieve a non-decreasing order, otherwise it will print "NO" along with an error message if applicable.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   YES
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes input validation. If the input does not meet the expected format or constraints, it will return an appropriate error message. Possible error messages include:
- "NO - The number of squares must be a positive integer."
- "NO - Heights list cannot be empty."
- "NO - Expected N heights, but got X."
- "NO - Heights must be non-negative integers."
- "Invalid input. Please enter integers only."

## Conclusion

This height checking application is a simple yet effective tool for determining the feasibility of achieving non-decreasing heights for a series of squares. By following the installation and usage instructions, you can easily run the application and check various height configurations.
