Read integers W and B from standard input. Validate the input constraints:\n   - Ensure that 0 ≤ W, B ≤ 100.\n   - Ensure that W + B ≥ 1. Define the infinite string S as 'wbwbwwbwbwbw'. Calculate the length of the repeating pattern in S, which is 12 (the length of the string). Create a function 'can_form_substring(W, B)' to determine if a substring with W occurrences of 'w' and B occurrences of 'b' can be formed. In 'can_form_substring', check if W and B can be achieved within the repeating pattern:\n   - Count the occurrences of 'w' and 'b' in one complete cycle of S.\n   - Determine how many complete cycles are needed to meet or exceed W and B. Check if the remaining characters after the complete cycles can satisfy the remaining W and B requirements. Return 'YES' if a valid substring can be formed, otherwise return 'NO'. Print the result of the function call 'can_form_substring(W, B)'.\n\nThis structured approach breaks down the problem into manageable subtasks, ensuring clarity in implementation and adherence to the problem constraints.
