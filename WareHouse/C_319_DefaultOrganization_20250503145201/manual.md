# 3x3 Grid Probability Calculator

A software application designed to calculate the probability of not getting disappointed based on a 3x3 grid of integers.

## Main Functions

The 3x3 Grid Probability Calculator performs the following key functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads a 3x3 grid of integers from standard input.
2. **Grid Validation**: Validates the grid to ensure:
   - No row contains the same number in all three cells.
   - No column contains the same number in all three cells.
   - The main diagonal does not contain the same number.
   - The anti-diagonal does not contain the same number.
3. **Disappointment Counting**: Counts the number of disappointing configurations based on permutations of the grid.
4. **Probability Calculation**: Computes the probability of not getting disappointed and formats the output to four decimal places.

## Installation

To run the 3x3 Grid Probability Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the software files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The software uses the built-in libraries, so no additional dependencies are required. Ensure you have `itertools` and `math` available in your Python environment.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Grid**: When prompted, enter the 3x3 grid of integers. You should input 9 integers in total, separated by spaces. For example:

   ```
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the grid, the application will validate the input and calculate the probability of not getting disappointed. The result will be printed in the terminal, formatted to four decimal places.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
Please enter the 3x3 grid of integers (9 integers total):
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Probability of not getting disappointed: 0.8889
```

## Conclusion

The 3x3 Grid Probability Calculator is a simple yet effective tool for analyzing configurations of a 3x3 grid of integers. By following the steps outlined in this manual, users can easily install and utilize the software to compute probabilities based on their grid inputs.
