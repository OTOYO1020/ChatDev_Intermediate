# Recent Positions Finder

A simple application to find the most recent positions of integers in a sequence.

## Overview

The Recent Positions Finder is designed to help users identify the last seen positions of integers in a list. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where tracking occurrences of elements is necessary, such as in data analysis or algorithm development.

## Main Functions

- **find_recent_positions(N: int, A: List[int]) -> List[int]**: This function takes the length of the sequence and a list of positive integers as input, and returns a list of integers representing the most recent positions of each element in the input list.

## Quick Install

To run the Recent Positions Finder, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. Here’s how:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: If there are no specific dependencies listed, you can skip this step.)*

## How to Use

1. **Run the application**:
   You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. Use the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the sequence**:
   When prompted, enter a sequence of positive integers separated by commas. For example:
   ```
   Enter a sequence of positive integers (comma-separated): 1, 2, 1, 3, 2
   ```

3. **View the result**:
   After entering the sequence, the application will process the input and display the result, which is a list of integers representing the most recent positions of each element in the input list. For the example above, the output will be:
   ```
   Result: [-1, -1, 0, -1, 1]
   ```

## Example Usage

Here’s a quick example to illustrate how the application works:

- **Input**: `5, 3, 5, 2, 3`
- **Output**: `[-1, -1, 0, -1, 1]`

This indicates that:
- The first occurrence of `5` is at index `0`.
- The first occurrence of `3` is at index `1`.
- The second occurrence of `5` is at index `2`, which is the most recent position for `5`.
- The first occurrence of `2` is at index `3`.
- The second occurrence of `3` is at index `4`, which is the most recent position for `3`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Input Error**: If you enter invalid input (e.g., non-integer values), the application will display an error message:
  ```
  Input Error: Please enter valid positive integers.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Recent Positions Finder is a straightforward tool that provides a quick way to track the most recent positions of integers in a sequence. For any further questions or support, please reach out to our support team.
