Define the function 'find_recent_positions(N: int, A: List[int]) -> List[int]' to handle the input parameters where 'N' is the length of the sequence and 'A' is the list of positive integers. Initialize an empty dictionary 'last_seen' to keep track of the most recent positions of each number in the sequence. Create a list 'B' of length 'N' initialized with -1 to store the results for each position. Iterate through the sequence 'A' using a loop with index 'i' from 0 to N-1. For each element 'A[i]', check if it exists in the 'last_seen' dictionary. If 'A[i]' exists in 'last_seen', set 'B[i]' to the value stored in 'last_seen[A[i]]'. Update the 'last_seen' dictionary with the current index 'i' for the element 'A[i]'. Continue the loop until all elements in 'A' have been processed. Return the list 'B' as the output of the function. Ensure the output format is a list of integers representing the most recent positions for each element in 'A'.
