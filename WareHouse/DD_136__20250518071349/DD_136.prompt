Define the function 'count_children(S: str) -> List[int]' to handle the input string S consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. Validate the input string S to ensure its length N is between 2 and 100,000 and that it starts with 'R' and ends with 'L'. Initialize a list 'children_count' of length N with all elements set to 1, representing one child on each square. Iterate through the string S from the leftmost square to the rightmost square, updating the position of each child based on the character 'L' or 'R'. For each 'R' at position i, increment the count of children at position i+1 (moving right). For each 'L' at position i, increment the count of children at position i-1 (moving left). After processing all characters in S, ensure that children do not move out of bounds (i.e., they cannot move left from the first square or right from the last square). Return the final 'children_count' list representing the number of children standing on each square after all moves. Implement test cases to validate the function with various input strings S. Output the result in the format of a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of children on each square.
