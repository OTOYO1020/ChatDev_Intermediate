Task:
Define the function 'count_potatoes_in_boxes(N: int, W: List[int], X: int, Q: int, K: List[int])' to handle the input parameters. Read the input values for N, W, X, Q, and K from standard input. Initialize a variable 'current_weight' to track the total weight of potatoes in the current box. Initialize a variable 'box_count' to count the number of boxes sealed. Iterate over the sequence of potatoes using a loop, packing potatoes into the box until 'current_weight' is greater than or equal to X. When sealing a box, increment 'box_count' and reset 'current_weight' to 0. Store the number of potatoes packed in each sealed box in a list 'potatoes_in_boxes'. For each query in K, retrieve the number of potatoes in the K[i]-th sealed box from 'potatoes_in_boxes'. Prepare the output list to store the results of each query. Print the results for each query in the required output format.
