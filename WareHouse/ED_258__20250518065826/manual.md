# Potato Packing Application

Efficiently pack potatoes into boxes based on weight constraints.

## Overview

The Potato Packing application is designed to help users pack potatoes into boxes while adhering to specified weight limits. The application reads input data regarding the weights of potatoes and processes them to determine how many potatoes can be packed into each box. Users can also query the number of potatoes packed in specific boxes.

## Main Functions

- **count_potatoes_in_boxes(N: int, W: List[int], X: int, Q: int, K: List[int])**: This function takes the number of potatoes, their weights, the weight limit for each box, the number of queries, and the specific queries themselves. It returns a list of results corresponding to the queries.

## Installation

To run the Potato Packing application, you need to set up your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # List any required libraries here
   ```

   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Potato Packing application, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your input data**: The input should be formatted as follows:
   - The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of potatoes.
   - The second line contains a comma-separated list of integers representing the weights of the potatoes.
   - The third line contains an integer `X`, the weight limit for each box.
   - The fourth line contains an integer `Q`, the number of queries.
   - The fifth line contains a comma-separated list of integers representing the queries.

   Example input:
   ```
   5
   1,2,3,4,5
   5
   3
   1,2,3
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py < input.txt
   ```
   Replace `input.txt` with the path to your input file.

3. **View the results**: The application will output the results of the queries in the format:
   ```
   Results: <result1>, <result2>, <result3>
   ```

## Example

Given the following input:
```
5
1,2,3,4,5
5
3
1,2,3
```

The output will be:
```
Results: 2, 2, 1
```

This indicates that:
- The first box contains 2 potatoes.
- The second box also contains 2 potatoes.
- The third box contains 1 potato.
