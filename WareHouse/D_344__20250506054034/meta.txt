Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of bags. Initialize an empty string 'S' to store the concatenated result. Create a list of lists 'bags' to hold the strings from each bag. For each bag index 'i' from 1 to N:\n   - Read the integer 'A_i', which indicates the number of strings in bag 'i'.\n   - Read the 'A_i' strings and store them in 'bags[i-1]'. Read the target string 'T' from standard input. Initialize a variable 'min_cost' to track the minimum cost required to form string 'T'. Implement a function 'can_form_string(S, T, bags)' that checks if 'T' can be formed by concatenating strings from the bags:\n   - Iterate through each character in 'T' and check if it can be matched with available strings in 'bags'.\n   - If a match is found, increment the cost and update 'S'.\n   - If 'S' matches 'T', return the total cost. Call 'can_form_string(S, T, bags)' to determine the minimum cost. If the cost is not updated (indicating 'T' cannot be formed), set 'min_cost' to -1. Print the value of 'min_cost' as the final output.
