# Ice Cream Satisfaction Application

This application calculates the maximum satisfaction from a selection of ice cream cups based on their flavors and deliciousness values. Users can input the number of cups, their respective flavors, and deliciousness ratings to find the optimal combination for maximum satisfaction.

## Main Functions

- **Input Number of Cups**: Users can specify how many ice cream cups they want to evaluate.
- **Input Flavors and Deliciousness**: For each cup, users can enter the flavor and a deliciousness score.
- **Calculate Maximum Satisfaction**: The application evaluates all possible pairs of cups to determine the maximum satisfaction based on the specified rules.
- **Output Result**: Displays the maximum satisfaction achieved or a message indicating that no valid satisfaction could be calculated.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Ice Cream Satisfaction application, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv ice_cream_env
   source ice_cream_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `ice_cream_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: While this application does not require any external libraries, you can create a `requirements.txt` file for future enhancements. For now, simply ensure you have Python installed.

   ```plaintext
   # requirements.txt
   # No additional libraries are required at this moment.
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Ice Cream Cups**: When prompted, enter the total number of ice cream cups (N). Ensure that N is at least 2 to calculate satisfaction.

3. **Input Flavors and Deliciousness**: For each cup, you will be prompted to enter:
   - The flavor (ensure it is not empty)
   - The deliciousness value (must be a non-negative integer)

4. **View the Result**: After all inputs are provided, the application will calculate and display the maximum satisfaction based on the entered values.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of ice cream cups: 3
Enter flavor for cup 1: Chocolate
Enter deliciousness for cup 1: 10
Enter flavor for cup 2: Vanilla
Enter deliciousness for cup 2: 20
Enter flavor for cup 3: Chocolate
Enter deliciousness for cup 3: 15
Max Satisfaction: 30
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Input Errors**: If you enter an invalid flavor or deliciousness value, the application will prompt you to re-enter the value.
- **No Valid Satisfaction**: If there are not enough valid pairs of cups to calculate satisfaction, the application will inform you accordingly.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the application does not require any additional libraries, you may consider adding features such as:
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Data persistence (saving and loading cup details)
- Enhanced input validation

For any issues or feature requests, please contact the development team.
