Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of socks. Read the array A of length N, where each element A[i] represents the color of the i-th sock. Initialize a dictionary 'color_count' to keep track of the count of each sock color. Iterate through the array A and populate 'color_count' with the frequency of each color. Initialize a variable 'max_pairs' to 0 to count the maximum number of pairs that can be formed. For each color in 'color_count', calculate the number of pairs that can be formed by integer division of the count by 2 and update 'max_pairs'. Print the value of 'max_pairs' as the final output.
