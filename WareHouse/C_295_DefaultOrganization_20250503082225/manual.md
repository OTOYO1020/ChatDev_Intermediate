# Sock Pair Counter

A simple application to count the maximum number of pairs of socks based on their colors.

## Quick Install

To run the Sock Pair Counter application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the application without any additional dependencies. Simply clone the repository or download the files.

## ü§î What is this?

The Sock Pair Counter application allows users to input the number of socks and their respective colors. The application then calculates and displays the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the given socks. This is useful for organizing and managing sock collections, especially when dealing with multiple colors.

## üì¶ Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**: The application prompts the user to enter the number of socks and their colors.
2. **Color Counting**: It counts the frequency of each sock color using a dictionary.
3. **Pair Calculation**: The application calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the counted colors.
4. **Output**: Finally, it displays the result to the user.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Run the application using the command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input the Number of Socks**:
   - When prompted, enter the total number of socks (N). Ensure this is a positive integer.

3. **Input Sock Colors**:
   - Enter the colors of the socks as a comma-separated list of integers. For example:
     ```
     1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3
     ```
   - Make sure the number of colors matches the number of socks entered.

4. **View the Result**:
   - The application will calculate and display the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.

## üö® Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:
- If the number of socks is not a positive integer.
- If the sock colors input is empty.
- If any sock color is not a valid integer.
- If the number of colors does not match the number of socks.

In case of an error, the application will display an appropriate message and exit.
