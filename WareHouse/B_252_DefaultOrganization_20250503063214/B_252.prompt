Read integers N and K from standard input. Read the tastiness values into an array A of length N. Read the indices of disliked foods into an array B of length K. Identify the maximum tastiness value from the array A. Create a list of indices of foods that have the maximum tastiness. Check if any of the indices in the list of maximum tastiness foods are present in the disliked foods array B. If there is an intersection, set a flag 'has_disliked_food' to True; otherwise, set it to False. Print 'Yes' if 'has_disliked_food' is True; otherwise, print 'No'.
