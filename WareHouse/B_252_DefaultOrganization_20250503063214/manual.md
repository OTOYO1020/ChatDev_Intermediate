# Tastiness Checker

A simple application to determine if the most tasty food item is disliked by the user.

## Overview

The Tastiness Checker application reads integers representing the number of food items and disliked food indices, evaluates the tastiness values of the food items, and checks if any of the most tasty items are disliked. The application outputs "Yes" if any of the most tasty items are disliked, and "No" otherwise.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of food items (N) and disliked food indices (K) from standard input.
- **Tastiness Evaluation**: Identifies the maximum tastiness value from the provided tastiness values.
- **Disliked Food Check**: Compares the indices of the most tasty food items with the disliked food indices to determine if there is any overlap.

## Installation

To run the Tastiness Checker application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application directly from the command line.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain two integers, N (number of food items) and K (number of disliked food indices).
   - The second line should contain N integers representing the tastiness values of the food items.
   - The third line should contain K integers representing the indices of the disliked food items.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5 2
   10 20 30 20 10
   1 3
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will print "Yes" if any of the most tasty food items are disliked, and "No" otherwise.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   Yes
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input scenarios:
- Non-negative integers for N and K.
- Correct number of tastiness values and disliked indices.
- Valid indices for disliked foods within the range of available food items.

If any error occurs, an appropriate error message will be printed to standard error.

## Conclusion

The Tastiness Checker is a straightforward application designed to help users quickly determine if their favorite food items are disliked. It is easy to use and requires no additional dependencies beyond Python itself.
