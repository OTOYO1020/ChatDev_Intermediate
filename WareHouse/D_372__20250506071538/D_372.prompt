Read the integer N from standard input, representing the number of buildings. Read the heights of the buildings into an array H of size N. Initialize an array 'result' of size N to store the count of valid buildings for each building. For each building index 'i' from 1 to N:\n   - Initialize a variable 'max_height' to 0 to track the tallest building encountered.\n   - For each building index 'j' from 'i + 1' to N:\n     - If the height of Building 'j' is greater than 'max_height', increment the count in 'result[i]'.\n     - Update 'max_height' with the height of Building 'j'. Print the values in the 'result' array, each on a new line.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid buildings for each building while adhering to the constraints provided.
