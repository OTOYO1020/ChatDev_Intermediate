# Building Validity Counter

A simple application to count valid buildings based on their heights.

## Overview

The Building Validity Counter allows users to input the number of buildings and their respective heights, and it calculates how many buildings are taller than each building to the right. This can be useful in various applications, such as urban planning or architectural analysis.

## Main Functions

- **Input Number of Buildings**: The application prompts the user to enter the total number of buildings.
- **Input Heights of Buildings**: Users can input the heights of the buildings in a space-separated format.
- **Count Valid Buildings**: The application processes the input and outputs the count of valid buildings for each building.

## Installation

To run the Building Validity Counter, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not have external dependencies, but ensure you have Python's standard library available.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file, and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of buildings (N).
   - Next, input the heights of the buildings as space-separated integers.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter the number of buildings: 5
   Enter the heights of the buildings (space-separated): 3 1 4 1 5
   ```

3. **View Results**: The application will output the count of valid buildings for each building, each on a new line.

   Example Output:
   ```
   3
   2
   1
   1
   0
   ```

## Example

Here is a complete example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the number of buildings:
   ```
   Enter the number of buildings: 4
   ```

3. Input the heights:
   ```
   Enter the heights of the buildings (space-separated): 2 5 3 4
   ```

4. Output will be:
   ```
   2
   1
   1
   0
   ```
