# Good Sequences Calculator

A software tool for calculating the number of good sequences based on pairs of integers.

## Overview

The Good Sequences Calculator allows users to input pairs of integers and calculates the number of valid contiguous subsequences of specified lengths. This tool is particularly useful for applications that require sequence validation based on predefined criteria.

## Main Functions

- **Input Pairs**: Users can input pairs of integers (A_i, B_i) that define valid positions.
- **Calculate Good Sequences**: The software computes the number of good sequences for lengths ranging from 1 to M based on the provided pairs.
- **Output**: The results are displayed as a list of counts for each sequence length.

## Installation

To run the Good Sequences Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The software does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. You can run the application directly without additional installations.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - You will be prompted to enter two integers, M and N:
     - **M**: The maximum length of sequences.
     - **N**: The number of pairs to input.
   - Next, you will be prompted to enter N pairs of integers (A_i, B_i) separated by commas. Ensure that both integers are between 1 and M.

3. **View Results**: After entering the pairs, the application will calculate and display the number of good sequences for lengths from 1 to M.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter M: 5
Enter N: 3
Enter pairs (A_i, B_i) separated by commas:
1,2
2,3
4,5
Good Sequences: [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter an invalid pair (where A or B is not between 1 and M), the application will prompt you to re-enter the pair.
- If the input format is incorrect, an error message will be displayed, and you will be asked to enter the pair again.

## Conclusion

The Good Sequences Calculator is a straightforward tool designed for efficient calculation of valid sequences based on user-defined pairs. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
