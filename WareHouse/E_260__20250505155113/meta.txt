Task:
Read integers M and N from standard input. Initialize an empty list 'pairs' to store the pairs of integers (A_i, B_i). For i from 1 to N, read each pair (A_i, B_i) and append it to 'pairs'. Create an array 'good_count' of size M initialized to 0 to keep track of valid positions for good sequences. For each pair (A_i, B_i) in 'pairs', mark the positions A_i and B_i in 'good_count' as valid (incrementing the count). Initialize an empty list 'f' to store the number of good sequences for lengths 1 to M. For each length k from 1 to M, calculate the number of good sequences 'f(k)' by checking contiguous subsequences of length k in 'good_count'. Store the results in the list 'f'. Print the values of 'f' from f(1) to f(M) as the final output. Ensure that the implementation handles the constraints efficiently, particularly for large values of N and M.
