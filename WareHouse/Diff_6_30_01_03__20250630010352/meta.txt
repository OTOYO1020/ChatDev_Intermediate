Task:
Read the integer N from standard input. Initialize a variable X to N. Create a loop to find the smallest integer X that satisfies the conditions:\n   - While true, check if there exist non-negative integers (a, b) such that \( X = a^3 + a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 \). To check the condition, create a nested loop for non-negative integers a and b:\n   - For each a starting from 0, compute \( a^3 \) and check if \( X - a^3 \) is non-negative.\n   - For each b starting from 0, compute \( b^3 \) and check if \( X - a^3 - b^3 \) can be expressed as \( a^2b + ab^2 \). If a valid pair (a, b) is found, break the loop. If no valid pair is found, increment X and repeat the checks. Once a valid X is found, print the value of X as the output.\n\nOutput format:\n- Print the smallest integer X that satisfies the conditions.
