# Smallest Integer Finder

This application is designed to find the smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the equation \( X = a^3 + a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 \) for non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \). 

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads a non-negative integer \( N \) from standard input.
- **Finding the Smallest Integer**: It initializes a variable \( X \) to \( N \) and checks for the smallest integer \( X \) that meets the specified conditions using nested loops.
- **Output**: The application prints the smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the conditions or informs the user if no valid \( X \) is found.

## Installation Instructions

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. You can do this using `pip`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can create one with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: After setting up the environment, you can run the application by executing:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Non-Negative Integer**: When prompted, enter a non-negative integer \( N \). The application will then search for the smallest integer \( X \) that satisfies the conditions.

3. **View the Output**: The application will print the result to the console. If a valid \( X \) is found, it will display:
   ```
   The smallest integer X is: <value>
   ```
   If no valid \( X \) is found, it will inform you:
   ```
   No valid X found.
   ```

## Example Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input a number when prompted:
   ```
   Enter a non-negative integer to find the smallest integer X: 10
   ```

3. View the output:
   ```
   The smallest integer X is: 10
   ```

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to find the smallest integer \( X \) based on the specified mathematical conditions. For any questions or issues, please refer to the documentation or contact support.
