Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of mountains. Initialize an empty list 'mountains' to store tuples of (height, name). For each mountain index 'i' from 0 to N-1:\n   - Read the name 'S_i' and height 'T_i' of the mountain.\n   - Append the tuple '(T_i, S_i)' to the 'mountains' list. Sort the 'mountains' list in descending order based on the height (first element of the tuple). Retrieve the second element of the sorted list, which corresponds to the second highest mountain. Extract the name of the second highest mountain from the tuple. Print the name of the second highest mountain.\n\n### Function and Variable Names:\n- Function to be implemented: 'find_second_highest_mountain(mountains)'\n- Variables: 'N', 'mountains', 'S_i', 'T_i', 'second_highest_mountain_name'
