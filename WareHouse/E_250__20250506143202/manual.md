# Set Comparison Application

This application is designed to efficiently compare sets derived from two integer sequences based on user-defined queries. It reads sequences and queries from standard input, processes them, and outputs the results indicating whether the sets are equal for each query.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads sequences and queries from standard input.
- **Set Comparison**: Compares sets derived from the sequences based on the queries.
- **Output Display**: Outputs the results of the comparisons to standard output.

## Quick Install

To run this application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install any required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For this specific project, there are no external dependencies required, so you can simply run the application without additional installations.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Input**: The application expects input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain two integers, `N` (length of sequences) and `Q` (number of queries).
   - The second line should contain `N` integers representing sequence A.
   - The third line should contain `N` integers representing sequence B.
   - The next `Q` lines should each contain two integers, `x_i` and `y_i`, representing the number of terms to extract from sequences A and B, respectively.

   Example Input:
   ```
   5 3
   1 2 3 4 5
   1 2 3 6 7
   3 3
   4 5
   2 4
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the application by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Output**: After processing the input, the application will output the results for each query on a new line. The output will be "Yes" if the sets are equal and "No" otherwise.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Yes
   No
   No
   ```

## Example Usage

To test the application, you can create a text file with the input format described above and redirect it to the application:

```bash
python main.py < input.txt
```

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet efficient way to compare sets derived from two sequences based on user-defined queries. It is designed to handle up to 200,000 queries efficiently, making it suitable for large datasets.
