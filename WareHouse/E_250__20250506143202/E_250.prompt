Read integers N and Q from standard input. Read the integer sequence A of length N. Read the integer sequence B of length N. For each query i from 1 to Q, read the integers x_i and y_i. Extract the first x_i terms from sequence A and the first y_i terms from sequence B. Convert the extracted terms from A and B into sets: 'set_A = set(A[:x_i])' and 'set_B = set(B[:y_i])'. Compare the two sets:\n   - If 'set_A' is equal to 'set_B', store the result as 'Yes'.\n   - Otherwise, store the result as 'No'. After processing all queries, print each result on a new line. Ensure that the solution handles up to 200,000 queries efficiently. Optimize set operations to ensure performance within the given constraints.
