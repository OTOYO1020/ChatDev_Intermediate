# Teleportation Simulation

A simple application to simulate teleportation between towns based on user-defined destinations.

## Overview

The Teleportation Simulation software allows users to determine the final town after a series of teleportations. Users can specify the number of towns, the teleport destinations for each town, and the number of teleportations to simulate. The application efficiently handles large values of teleportations and detects cycles in the teleportation path.

## Main Functions

- **find_final_town(N: int, A: List[int], K: int) -> int**: This function encapsulates the logic for determining the final town after K teleportations. It validates input, tracks the current town, and detects cycles to optimize the teleportation process.

## Installation

To run the Teleportation Simulation application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip. 

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Run the Application

To start the application, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Input Parameters

The application will prompt you to enter the following parameters:

1. **Number of towns (N)**: Enter the total number of towns available.
2. **Teleport destinations (A)**: Enter the teleport destinations as a comma-separated list. Each destination should correspond to the town number you can teleport to from the current town.
3. **Number of teleportations (K)**: Enter the number of teleportations you want to simulate.

### Example Input

```
Enter number of towns (N): 5
Enter teleport destinations (A) as comma-separated values: 2,3,4,5,1
Enter number of teleportations (K): 10
```

### Step 3: View the Result

After entering the parameters, the application will calculate the final town after K teleportations and display the result:

```
Final Town: 4
```

## Edge Cases

- If `K` is 0, the application will return Town 1, as no teleportations are performed.
- If there is only one town (`N` = 1), the application will always return Town 1, regardless of the value of `K`.

## Testing the Function

You can validate the function by creating test cases that cover various scenarios, including:

- Normal cases with small values of `N` and `K`.
- Edge cases with `K` equal to 0 or very large compared to `N`.
- Cases where teleportation paths create cycles.

## Conclusion

The Teleportation Simulation application provides a straightforward way to simulate teleportation between towns. By following the instructions above, users can easily install and run the application to explore different teleportation scenarios.
