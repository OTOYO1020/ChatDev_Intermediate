Task:
Define a function 'min_operations_to_atcoder(S: str) -> int' to calculate the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to transform the string S into 'atcoder'. Implement a helper function 'count_inversions(S: str) -> int' that counts the number of inversions in the string S, which will help determine the number of swaps needed. Within 'min_operations_to_atcoder', validate that the input string S is a permutation of 'atcoder'. If not, return -1 or raise an exception. Use a loop to iterate through the characters of S and compare their positions to those in 'atcoder'. For each character in S, calculate how many adjacent swaps are needed to move it to its correct position in 'atcoder'. Accumulate the total number of swaps required by summing the results from the previous step. Return the total number of swaps as the output of the function 'min_operations_to_atcoder'. Handle the input format by reading the string S from standard input. Ensure that the output format is an integer representing the minimum number of operations required. Test the function with various permutations of 'atcoder' to ensure correctness and efficiency.
