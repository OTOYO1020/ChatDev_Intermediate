# 11/22 Substring Length Calculator

This application calculates the maximum length of valid 11/22 substrings from a given input string. It identifies substrings that are structured around the character '/' with '1's on the left and '2's on the right.

## Main Functions

- **calculate_max_length(input_string)**: This function takes a string as input and returns the maximum length of valid 11/22 substrings. It checks for valid characters, identifies centers of potential substrings, and expands outward to determine the length of valid substrings.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using the following methods:

1. **Using pip**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Using conda** (if you prefer):
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge
   ```

*Note: The `requirements.txt` file is currently empty, indicating no additional dependencies are required beyond Python itself.*

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   To execute the application, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the String**:
   After running the application, you will be prompted to enter a string. The string should consist of characters '1', '2', and '/' only. For example:
   ```
   111/222
   ```

3. **View the Output**:
   The application will process the input string and output a single integer representing the maximum length of a contiguous substring that is a valid 11/22 string. For example:
   ```
   7
   ```

## Example

### Input:
```
111/222
```

### Output:
```
7
```

### Explanation:
In the above example, the entire string is a valid 11/22 substring, hence the maximum length is 7.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to determine the maximum length of valid 11/22 substrings from a given input string. For any issues or further inquiries, please contact our support team.
