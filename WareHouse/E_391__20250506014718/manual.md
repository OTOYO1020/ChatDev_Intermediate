# Majority Operation Application

This application performs a majority operation on a binary string, allowing users to determine the minimum number of changes required to flip the majority value of the string.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads an integer \(N\) from standard input, ensuring it falls within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 13\).
   - Reads a binary string \(A\) of length \(3^N\) and validates that it consists only of '0's and '1's.

2. **Majority Operation**:
   - The `majority_operation(B)` function partitions the binary string \(B\) into groups of 3 and determines the majority value for each group, producing a new binary string \(C\) of length \(3^{N-1}\).

3. **Change Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_min_changes(A, target)` function computes the minimum number of changes needed in the original string \(A\) to achieve the desired target value for the majority operation result.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum number of changes required to flip the majority value of the original string.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. However, ensure you have Python version 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository containing the application files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file `main.py` using Python.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Requirements**:
   - When prompted, enter an integer \(N\) (between 1 and 13).
   - Next, enter a binary string \(A\) of length \(3^N\) consisting only of '0's and '1's.

4. **View Results**:
   After processing, the application will output the minimum number of changes required to flip the majority value of the original string.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter N (1-13): 2
Enter binary string A: 110001000
Minimum changes required: 1
```
