# Employee Work Time Calculator

This software calculates the minimum time required to complete two works based on the time taken by employees to complete each work. It allows users to input the time taken by each employee for Work A and Work B, and then computes the optimal assignment of tasks to minimize the total time.

## Main Functions

- **Input Employee Times**: Users can input the time taken by each employee for Work A and Work B.
- **Calculate Minimum Time**: The software calculates the minimum time required to complete both works, either by assigning both tasks to a single employee or by distributing the tasks among different employees.
- **Error Handling**: The software includes input validation to ensure that the user provides valid data.

## Installation

To run the Employee Work Time Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Verify Installation**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   This should display the installed version of Python.

3. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: You can run the application directly using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Start the Application**: Run the `main.py` file using Python. The application will prompt you for input.

2. **Input the Number of Employees**: Enter the number of employees when prompted. Ensure that the number is greater than 0.

3. **Input Times for Work A**: You will be prompted to enter the times taken by each employee for Work A. Enter the times as comma-separated values (e.g., `3,5,2` for three employees).

4. **Input Times for Work B**: Next, you will be prompted to enter the times taken by each employee for Work B in the same format.

5. **View the Result**: After entering the times, the application will calculate and display the minimum time required to complete both works.

6. **Error Handling**: If you enter invalid data (e.g., non-integer values, negative numbers, or incorrect number of entries), the application will prompt you to re-enter the data.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of employees (must be greater than 0): 3
Enter times for Work A (comma-separated, no spaces): 3,5,2
Enter times for Work B (comma-separated, no spaces): 4,1,6
Minimum Time: 5
```

## Conclusion

The Employee Work Time Calculator is a simple yet effective tool for optimizing task assignments among employees. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and utilize the software to improve productivity and efficiency in their work processes.
