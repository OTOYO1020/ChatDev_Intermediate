Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of problems and submissions, respectively. Initialize a dictionary 'penalties' to keep track of the number of 'WA's for each problem before receiving an 'AC'. Initialize a set 'correct_answers' to store the problems for which Takahashi received an 'AC'. Loop through M submissions:\n   - For each submission, read the problem index 'p_i' and the verdict 'S_i'.\n   - If 'S_i' is 'WA', increment the count of 'WA's for problem 'p_i' in 'penalties'.\n   - If 'S_i' is 'AC', add problem 'p_i' to the 'correct_answers' set and ensure to record the penalties for that problem. Calculate the total number of correct answers as the size of the 'correct_answers' set. Initialize a variable 'total_penalties' to 0. For each problem in 'correct_answers', add the corresponding count of 'WA's from 'penalties' to 'total_penalties'. Print the total number of correct answers and the total penalties.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output should consist of two integers: the number of correct answers and the total penalties, printed on the same line.
