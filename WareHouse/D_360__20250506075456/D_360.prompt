Read integers N and T from standard input. Read the binary string S of length N from standard input. Read the list of initial coordinates X (length N) from standard input. Initialize a list 'final_positions' to store the final positions of each ant after time (T + 0.1). For each ant i (from 1 to N):\n   - Calculate the final position based on its initial position X[i] and direction S[i]:\n     - If S[i] is '0', the final position is 'X[i] - (T + 0.1)'.\n     - If S[i] is '1', the final position is 'X[i] + (T + 0.1}'.\n   - Store the calculated final position in 'final_positions'. Sort the 'final_positions' list to facilitate counting pairs of ants that pass each other. Initialize a counter 'pass_count' to zero. For each pair of ants (i, j) where i < j, check if 'final_positions[i]' is greater than 'final_positions[j]':\n   - If true, increment 'pass_count'. Print the value of 'pass_count' as the final output.
