# Sum of K Smallest Elements

This software provides a function to compute the sum of the K smallest elements from each subarray of a specified length within a given integer sequence.

## Main Functions

- **sum_of_k_smallest(A: List[int], N: int, M: int, K: int) -> List[int]**: This function takes an integer sequence and computes the sum of the K smallest elements for each subarray of length M.

## Quick Install

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This software requires no external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input the Integer Sequence**: When prompted, enter the integer sequence as a comma-separated list. For example:

   ```
   Enter the integer sequence (comma-separated): 5,3,8,6,2,7
   ```

4. **Specify M and K**: You will then be prompted to enter the values for M (subarray length) and K (number of smallest elements to sum):

   ```
   Enter M (subarray length): 3
   Enter K (number of smallest elements): 2
   ```

5. **View Results**: After entering the inputs, the program will compute the results and display them:

   ```
   Results: [8, 5, 9, 8]
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the integer sequence is empty, it will prompt an error message.
- If M is less than or equal to 0 or greater than N, it will raise a ValueError.
- If K is less than or equal to 0 or greater than M, it will raise a ValueError.
- If N is less than M, it will raise a ValueError.

## Example

For an input sequence of `5,3,8,6,2,7`, with M = 3 and K = 2, the function will evaluate the following subarrays:

- Subarray [5, 3, 8]: K smallest are [3, 5], sum = 8
- Subarray [3, 8, 6]: K smallest are [3, 6], sum = 9
- Subarray [8, 6, 2]: K smallest are [2, 6], sum = 8
- Subarray [6, 2, 7]: K smallest are [2, 6], sum = 8

Thus, the output will be `[8, 9, 8, 8]`.

## Conclusion

This software is designed to be simple and efficient for calculating the sum of the K smallest elements from subarrays. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
