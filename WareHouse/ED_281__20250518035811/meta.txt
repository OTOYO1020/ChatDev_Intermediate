Task:
Define a function 'sum_of_k_smallest(A: List[int], N: int, M: int, K: int) -> List[int]' to encapsulate the solution logic. Parse the input to extract the integer sequence 'A', and the integers 'N', 'M', and 'K'. Implement a loop that iterates from 'i = 0' to 'N - M' to process each subarray of length 'M'. For each subarray 'A[i:i + M]', sort the subarray in ascending order. Extract the first 'K' elements from the sorted subarray. Calculate the sum of the first 'K' elements. Store the sum in a results list. Return the results list after processing all subarrays. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when 'K' equals 'M'. Format the output as a list of integers representing the sums for each subarray.
