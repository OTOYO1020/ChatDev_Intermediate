Task:
Read the integers X, Y, and Z from standard input. Initialize a variable 'min_distance' to a large value (e.g., infinity). Check if Takahashi can reach the goal directly:\n   - If X < Y, calculate the distance as 'abs(X - 0)' and update 'min_distance'. Check if Takahashi can reach the goal after picking up the hammer:\n   - If Z < Y and X > Y, calculate the distance as 'abs(Z - 0) + abs(Y - Z) + abs(X - Y)' and update 'min_distance'. If neither condition allows reaching the goal, set 'min_distance' to -1. Print the 'min_distance' as the output.
