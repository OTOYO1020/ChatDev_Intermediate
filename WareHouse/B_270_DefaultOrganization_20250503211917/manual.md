# Minimum Distance Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum distance Takahashi needs to reach his goal based on his starting position, the goal position, and the hammer's position.

## Main Functions

The Minimum Distance Calculator performs the following key functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads three integer inputs from the user: 
   - X: Takahashi's starting position.
   - Y: The goal position.
   - Z: The position of the hammer.

2. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - If Takahashi can reach the goal directly (X < Y), it calculates the distance from the starting point (0) to X.
   - If Takahashi can reach the goal after picking up the hammer (Z < Y and X > Y), it calculates the total distance as the sum of the distances from the starting point to Z, from Z to Y, and from Y to X.
   - If neither condition is met, it returns -1 indicating that reaching the goal is not possible.

3. **Output**: Displays the minimum distance required for Takahashi to reach his goal.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Minimum Distance Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: The application will prompt you to enter three integer values:
   - Enter the integer value for X (Takahashi's starting point).
   - Enter the integer value for Y (Goal position).
   - Enter the integer value for Z (Hammer position).

3. **Validation**: The application will validate the inputs. If the inputs are not valid integers, it will prompt you to enter valid integers again.

4. **View Result**: After entering valid inputs, the application will calculate and display the minimum distance required for Takahashi to reach his goal.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the integer value for X (Takahashi's starting point): 3
Enter the integer value for Y (Goal position): 5
Enter the integer value for Z (Hammer position): 2
Minimum Distance: 3
```

In this example, Takahashi can reach the goal directly, and the minimum distance calculated is 3.

## Conclusion

The Minimum Distance Calculator is a straightforward application designed to help users determine the distance Takahashi needs to travel to reach his goal based on specified conditions. For any issues or further assistance, please contact our support team.
