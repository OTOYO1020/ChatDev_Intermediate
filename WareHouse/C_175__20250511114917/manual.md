## üéÆ How to Play

2. **Making a Move:**
   - Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (0-14).
   - For example, entering `7` for the row and `8` for the column places your piece at the position (7, 8) on the board.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player gets five pieces in a row, they will be declared the winner.

4. **Handling Invalid Moves:**

5. **Game Continuation:**
   - After a win or a draw, players will be asked if they want to play again. Enter `y` to continue or `n` to exit the game.

- The game is played on a 15x15 board.
- Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1 (X).
