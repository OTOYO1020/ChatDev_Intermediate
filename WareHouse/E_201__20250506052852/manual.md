# Tree XOR Distance Calculator

Efficiently calculate the XOR distances in a weighted tree structure.

## Overview

The Tree XOR Distance Calculator is a Python application designed to compute the XOR distances between vertices in a weighted tree. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and calculate distances efficiently.

## Main Functions

1. **Graph Representation**: The application uses an adjacency list to represent the weighted tree.
2. **XOR Distance Calculation**: It computes the XOR distance between pairs of vertices using a DFS approach.
3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final sum of distances is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

## Installation

To run the Tree XOR Distance Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**: This application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. Just ensure you have Python installed.

## Usage

To use the Tree XOR Distance Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   - First, enter the integer `N`, which represents the number of vertices in the tree.
   - Then, for each edge from `1` to `N-1`, input the vertices `u_i`, `v_i`, and the weight `w_i` in the following format:
     ```
     u_i v_i w_i
     ```
   - Example input for a tree with 3 vertices:
     ```
     3
     1 2 5
     1 3 10
     ```

3. **Output**: The application will print the total sum of XOR distances modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the application:

```bash
$ python main.py
3
1 2 5
1 3 10
```

**Output**:
```
15
```

## Conclusion

The Tree XOR Distance Calculator is a powerful tool for efficiently computing distances in a weighted tree. By leveraging DFS and modular arithmetic, it provides accurate results for various applications in graph theory and data analysis.
