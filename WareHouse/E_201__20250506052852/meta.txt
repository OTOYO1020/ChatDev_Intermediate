Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of vertices in the tree. Initialize an adjacency list 'graph' to represent the weighted tree. For each edge from 1 to N-1, read the vertices 'u_i', 'v_i', and the weight 'w_i' from standard input and populate the 'graph' with these edges. Implement a function 'dfs(x, parent)' to perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to compute the XOR distance from vertex 'x' to all other vertices, storing results in a 'xor_dist' array. For each vertex 'i' from 1 to N, call 'dfs(i, -1)' to compute the XOR distances for all pairs '(i, j)' where 'j > i'. Initialize a variable 'total_sum' to accumulate the sum of all 'dist(i, j)' values. For each pair '(i, j)' where '1 ≤ i < j ≤ N', compute 'dist(i, j)' using the precomputed 'xor_dist' values and add it to 'total_sum'. Take 'total_sum' modulo '(10^9 + 7)' to handle large numbers. Print the final value of 'total_sum'.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required distances in the tree and handle the constraints provided.
