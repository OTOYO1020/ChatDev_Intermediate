# Integer Average Subset Counter

A Python application for counting valid subsets of a sequence of integers that have an integer-valued average.

## Overview

This software allows users to input a sequence of positive integers and calculates the number of non-empty subsets whose average is an integer. It utilizes bit manipulation to efficiently iterate through all possible subsets.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the length of the sequence and the sequence itself from standard input.
- **Subset Counting**: Calculates the number of valid subsets with integer-valued averages.
- **Output**: Prints the result modulo 998244353 to ensure it fits within the required modulus.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not have external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. No additional installations are required.

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main script in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Length of the Sequence**: When prompted, enter the integer `N`, which represents the length of the sequence. Ensure that `N` is between 1 and 20.

   ```
   Enter the length of the sequence (N): 5
   ```

3. **Input the Sequence of Positive Integers**: Enter `N` positive integers separated by spaces. Ensure that the number of integers matches `N`.

   ```
   Enter 5 positive integers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5
   ```

4. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and print the number of valid subsets with integer-valued averages.

   ```
   Result: 31
   ```

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input:
   ```
   Enter the length of the sequence (N): 3
   Enter 3 positive integers separated by spaces: 1 2 3
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   Result: 7
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If `N` is not between 1 and 20, an error message will be displayed.
- If the length of the sequence does not match `N`, an error message will be displayed.
- If any integer in the sequence is not positive, an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet effective way to count subsets with integer-valued averages from a sequence of positive integers. For any questions or support, please contact the development team.
