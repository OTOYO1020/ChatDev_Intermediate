Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the sequence A. Read the sequence of positive integers A from standard input, ensuring that the length of A is N. Initialize a variable 'count' to zero to keep track of the number of valid subsets with an integer-valued average. Iterate over all possible non-empty subsets of A using bit manipulation (from 1 to 2^N - 1). For each subset, calculate the sum of the elements and the number of elements in the subset. Check if the average of the subset (sum divided by the number of elements) is an integer:\n   - If it is, increment the 'count' variable. Compute the final result as 'count % 998244353' to ensure it fits within the required modulus. Print the final result.\n\nIn this case, the function to handle the given arguments could be defined as 'count_integer_averages(N, A)' where N is the length of the sequence and A is the list of integers. The output format will be the integer result printed to standard output.
