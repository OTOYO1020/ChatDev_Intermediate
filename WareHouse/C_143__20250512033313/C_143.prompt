Define the function 'count_fused_slimes(S: str) -> int' to handle the input string 'S' representing the colors of the slimes. Initialize a variable 'fused_count' to 0 to keep track of the number of distinct slimes after fusion. Iterate through the string 'S' using a loop to compare each character with the previous one. If the current character is different from the previous character, increment 'fused_count' by 1. Set the first character of 'S' as the initial value for 'fused_count' since it represents the first distinct slime. Ensure the loop starts from the second character of 'S' to avoid index errors. Return the value of 'fused_count' after completing the iteration through the string. Handle edge cases where 'S' is empty or has only one character, returning 0 or 1 respectively. Test the function with various input cases to ensure correctness, including maximum constraints. Output the final count of distinct slimes after fusion as an integer.
