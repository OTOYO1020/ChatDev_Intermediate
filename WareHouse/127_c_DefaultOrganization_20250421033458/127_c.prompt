Receiving input and initialization: Receive N (number of ID cards) and M (number of gates) from standard input, read the following M lines of (L_i, R_i), and store the passable range of each gate in the list gates. Calculating the intersection of the passable range: To pass through all gates with one ID card, that ID card must be included in the passable range of all gates. Therefore, find the intersection range [max(L_i), min(R_i)] of all (L_i, R_i) intervals. Calculating the number of ID cards included in the intersection range: In the intersection range [L_max, R_min], the number of ID cards i that satisfy L_max ≤ i ≤ R_min is the number of cards that can pass through all gates with one card. Calculate this as count. If L_max > R_min, there is no intersection, so set count = 0. Outputting the result: Output the calculated count as an integer on one line. This is the answer.
