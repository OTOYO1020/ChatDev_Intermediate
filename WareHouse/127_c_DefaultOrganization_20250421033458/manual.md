# ID Card Gate Application

A simple application to determine how many ID cards can pass through a series of gates based on specified ranges.

## Main Functions

The ID Card Gate application performs the following main functions:

1. **Input Reception**: 
   - Accepts the number of ID cards (N) and the number of gates (M) from the user.
   - Collects the passable range for each gate in the format (L, R).

2. **Range Intersection Calculation**:
   - Computes the intersection of the passable ranges of all gates to determine the valid range for ID cards.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - Calculates how many ID cards fall within the intersection range and outputs this count.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Validates user inputs to ensure they are in the correct format and provides informative error messages.

## Installation

To run the ID Card Gate application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: 
   - Download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - When prompted, enter the number of ID cards (N) as a positive integer.
   - Next, enter the number of gates (M) as a positive integer.
   - For each gate, input the range in the format `L,R`, where L is the lower bound and R is the upper bound of the gate's passable range.

3. **View Results**:
   - After entering all gate ranges, the application will calculate and display the number of ID cards that can pass through all gates.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of ID Cards (N): 10
Enter the number of Gates (M): 3
Enter gate range (L, R): 1,5
Enter gate range (L, R): 2,6
Enter gate range (L, R): 3,4
```

Output:
```plaintext
Count of ID cards that can pass through all gates: 2
```

## Error Handling

- If you enter invalid data (e.g., a negative number or a non-integer), the application will prompt you to re-enter the data until valid input is provided.
- If the gate range is not in the correct format (e.g., `L` is greater than `R`), the application will ask for the input again.

## Conclusion

The ID Card Gate application is a straightforward tool for determining how many ID cards can pass through a series of gates based on specified ranges. It is user-friendly and includes input validation to ensure a smooth experience.
