# Distance Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach a target point (X, Y) from the origin (0, 0) based on a given step distance (R).

## Main Functions

The Distance Calculator performs the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads integers R, X, and Y from the user.
2. **Distance Calculation**: Computes the Euclidean distance from the origin to the target point using the formula:
   \[
   D = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}
   \]
3. **Step Calculation**: Determines the minimum number of steps required to reach the target point using the formula:
   \[
   \text{steps} = \lceil \frac{D}{R} \rceil
   \]
4. **Output**: Displays the minimum number of steps to the user.

## Installation

To run the Distance Calculator, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:

- `math` (included in the Python standard library, no installation needed)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the Distance Calculator code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Values**: Follow the prompts to enter the values for R, X, and Y:
   - R: The distance that can be covered in one step (must be greater than 0).
   - X: The x-coordinate of the target point (must be a non-negative integer).
   - Y: The y-coordinate of the target point (must be a non-negative integer).

4. **View Results**: After entering valid inputs, the application will calculate and display the minimum number of steps required to reach the target point.

## Example Usage

```
Enter R (must be > 0): 5
Enter X (must be >= 0): 3
Enter Y (must be >= 0): 4
Minimum Steps: 1
```

In this example, the user has entered R = 5, X = 3, and Y = 4. The application calculates the Euclidean distance as 5 and determines that only 1 step is required to reach the target point.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter a value that does not meet the requirements (e.g., R <= 0, X < 0, or Y < 0), the application will prompt you to enter the value again.
- **Non-integer Input**: If you enter a non-integer value, the application will display an error message and ask for valid integers.

## Conclusion

The Distance Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating the minimum steps required to reach a target point based on user-defined parameters. For any further questions or support, please contact our support team.
