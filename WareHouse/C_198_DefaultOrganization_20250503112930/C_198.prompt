Read integers R, X, and Y from standard input. Calculate the Euclidean distance 'D' from the origin (0, 0) to the target point (X, Y) using the formula: \n   \[\n   D = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}\n   \] Determine the minimum number of steps 'steps' required to reach the point (X, Y) by calculating:\n   \[\n   \text{steps} = \lceil \frac{D}{R} \rceil\n   \]\n   where \(\lceil \cdot \rceil\) denotes the ceiling function. Print the value of 'steps' as the output.\n\nThis breakdown ensures that all necessary calculations and inputs are handled systematically to arrive at the solution.
