# String Comparison Application

A simple application designed to calculate the minimum number of character changes needed to transform a substring of one string into another.

## Main Functions

- **Input Strings**: The application prompts the user to input two strings, `S` and `T`.
- **Validation**: It checks if both strings are non-empty and ensures that string `T` is not longer than string `S`.
- **Calculate Minimum Changes**: The application calculates the minimum number of character changes required to match any substring of `S` with `T`.
- **Output**: The result is displayed as the minimum number of changes required.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: Currently, there are no external dependencies required for this application.)*

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the application files are located and run the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Input Strings**: When prompted, enter the first string `S` and then the second string `T`. Ensure that both strings are non-empty and that `T` is not longer than `S`.
3. **View Results**: After entering the strings, the application will calculate and display the minimum number of character changes required.

### Example Usage

- **Input**:
  ```
  Enter String S: hello
  Enter String T: world
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  Minimum Changes: 4
  ```

## Additional Information

- If either string is empty or if `T` is longer than `S`, the application will notify you with an appropriate message.
- The application uses a straightforward algorithm to compare substrings, ensuring efficient performance for typical use cases.
