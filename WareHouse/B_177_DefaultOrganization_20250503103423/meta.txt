Task:
Read the two strings 'S' and 'T' from standard input. Initialize a variable 'min_changes' to store the minimum number of character changes needed, starting at a high value (e.g., 'float('inf')'). Calculate the lengths of 'S' and 'T', storing them in variables 'len_S' and 'len_T'. Loop through all possible starting indices 'i' in 'S' where 'T' could fit:\n   - For each index 'i', extract the substring 'sub_S' from 'S' that starts at 'i' and has the same length as 'T'. For each 'sub_S', compare it with 'T' character by character:\n   - Count the number of differing characters and store this count in a variable 'changes'. Update 'min_changes' if 'changes' is less than the current value of 'min_changes'. After checking all possible substrings, the value of 'min_changes' will represent the minimum number of changes needed. Print the value of 'min_changes' as the final output.
