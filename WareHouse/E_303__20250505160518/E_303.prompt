Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of vertices in the tree T. Initialize an empty list 'edges' to store the edges of the tree. For i from 1 to N-1, read the pairs of integers (u_i, v_i) from standard input and append them to the 'edges' list. Construct the adjacency list representation of the tree using the 'edges' list. Initialize a variable 'star_count' to 0 to keep track of the number of stars in the original graph. For each vertex in the tree, check if it has a degree of 1 (leaf node):\n   - If it does, check its connected vertex's degree. If the connected vertex has a degree of k (where k >= 2), increment 'star_count'. After checking all vertices, output the 'star_count' which represents the number of level-k stars in the original graph. \n\nOutput format: Print the value of 'star_count'.
