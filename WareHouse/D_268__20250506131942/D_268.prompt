Read integers N and M from standard input. Read N strings \( S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N \) from standard input. Read M strings \( T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_M \) from standard input. Generate all permutations of the list \( S \) to create potential usernames. For each permutation, concatenate the strings with at least one underscore '_' between them to form candidate usernames. Check the length of each candidate username to ensure it is between 3 and 16 characters inclusive. Verify that the candidate username does not match any of the strings \( T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_M \). If a valid username is found, store it; otherwise, continue checking other permutations. If no valid username is found after checking all permutations, prepare to output '-1'. Print the valid username or '-1' if none exists.
