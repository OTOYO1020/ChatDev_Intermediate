# Username Generator

A simple application to generate unique usernames based on user-defined strings while avoiding taken usernames.

## Main Functions

The Username Generator application performs the following key functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads integers N and M, followed by N strings for username generation and M strings for taken usernames.
2. **Username Generation**: Generates all permutations of the input strings and concatenates them with underscores to form candidate usernames.
3. **Validation**: Checks each candidate username for length (between 3 and 16 characters) and ensures it does not match any taken usernames.
4. **Output**: Prints a valid username or '-1' if no valid username can be generated.

## Installation

To run the Username Generator application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: The application uses the `itertools` module, which is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installations are required.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located.

2. **Execute the Script**: Run the main application script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter the following:
   - First, enter the integer N (the number of strings for username generation).
   - Next, enter N strings, one per line.
   - Then, enter the integer M (the number of taken usernames).
   - Finally, enter M strings, one per line.

   Example input:
   ```
   3
   user
   name
   test
   2
   user_name
   test_user
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will output a valid username or '-1' if no valid username can be generated based on the provided input.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how the application works:

### Input
```
3
alice
bob
charlie
2
alice_bob
bob_charlie
```

### Output
```
alice_charlie_bob
```

In this case, the application generates a valid username `alice_charlie_bob` since it is not taken and meets the length requirements.

## Conclusion

The Username Generator application is a straightforward tool for creating unique usernames based on user-defined strings while avoiding conflicts with existing usernames. Feel free to modify the code to fit your specific needs or integrate it into larger applications.
