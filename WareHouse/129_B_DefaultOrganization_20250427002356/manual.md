# Weight Difference Calculator

A simple application to calculate the minimum absolute difference between two sums of weights based on user input.

## Main Functions

The Weight Difference Calculator provides the following functionalities:

- **Input Handling**: Reads an integer `N` and an array `W` of size `N` from standard input.
- **Weight Validation**: Ensures that all weights are positive integers and that the correct number of weights is provided.
- **Minimum Difference Calculation**: Computes the minimum absolute difference between the sums of two groups of weights based on possible divisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Prompts the user for input and provides error messages for invalid entries.

## Installation

To run the Weight Difference Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`. 

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any future dependencies here
   ```

   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Weights**:
   When prompted, enter a positive integer `N` which represents the number of weights you will input.

3. **Input the Weights**:
   Enter the weights separated by spaces. Ensure that you provide exactly `N` positive integers.

4. **View the Result**:
   After entering the weights, the application will calculate and display the minimum absolute difference between the sums of the two groups of weights.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If you enter an invalid number for `N`, the application will prompt you to try again up to three times.
   - If the weights input is invalid (e.g., not enough weights, negative values), the application will also prompt you to re-enter the weights.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number of weights (1-based index): 4
Enter weights separated by spaces (1-based index): 10 20 15 5
Minimum Difference: 0
```

## Future Enhancements

If you anticipate needing additional functionalities, consider including libraries such as `numpy` or `pandas` in the `requirements.txt` file for enhanced data manipulation capabilities.
