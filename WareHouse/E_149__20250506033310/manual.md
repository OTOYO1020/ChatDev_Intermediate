# Guest Handshake Happiness Calculator

A simple application to calculate the total happiness based on handshakes among guests, where each guest has a certain power level.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads the number of guests and handshakes, as well as the power levels of each guest.
- **Happiness Calculation**: It calculates the total happiness based on unique handshakes between guests.
- **Unique Handshake Management**: Ensures that no handshake is repeated.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - **Number of Guests (N)**: Enter an integer representing the number of guests.
   - **Number of Handshakes (M)**: Enter an integer representing the number of handshakes to perform.
   - **Enter Powers**: Provide a space-separated list of integers representing the power of each guest.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Number of Guests (N): 5
   Number of Handshakes (M): 3
   Enter Powers (space-separated): 10 20 30 40 50
   ```

3. **Output**: The application will calculate and display the total happiness based on the unique handshakes performed.

   Example Output:
   ```
   Total Happiness: 90
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- If the number of powers entered does not match the number of guests.
- If the number of handshakes exceeds the maximum possible unique pairs of guests.
- General input errors will also be caught and displayed.

## Conclusion

This application provides a fun and interactive way to explore the concept of handshakes and happiness among guests. Feel free to modify the code to enhance its functionality or adapt it for different scenarios.
