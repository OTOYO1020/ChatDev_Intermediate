Task:
Define the function 'count_illuminated_squares(H: int, W: int, bulbs: List[Tuple[int, int]], blocks: List[Tuple[int, int]])' to handle the input parameters for grid dimensions and positions of bulbs and blocks. Create a grid representation using a 2D list to store the state of each square (whether it is a bulb, block, or empty). Iterate through the list of bulbs and mark their positions in the grid as 'bulb'. Iterate through the list of blocks and mark their positions in the grid as 'block'. For each bulb, implement a function to illuminate squares in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a block is encountered or the edge of the grid is reached. Ensure that the squares illuminated by the bulbs are marked in the grid, including the bulb's own position. Count the total number of squares that are illuminated and not blocked, ensuring not to double count any illuminated squares. Return the count of illuminated squares as the output of the function. Handle edge cases such as bulbs or blocks being at the grid boundaries. Ensure that the function adheres to the input and output formats specified in the problem statement.
