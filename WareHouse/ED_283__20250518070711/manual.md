# Matrix Isolation Software

This software is designed to handle matrix operations, specifically to determine the minimum number of operations required to ensure that no element in a given matrix is isolated. 

## Main Functions

The software includes the following key functions:

- **min_operations_to_isolate(H: int, W: int, A: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[bool, int]**: 
  - This function takes the dimensions of the matrix (H and W) and the matrix itself (A) as input. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if it is possible to make the matrix non-isolated and the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

- **is_isolated(i: int, j: int, A: List[List[int]], H: int, W: int) -> bool**: 
  - A helper function that checks if a specific element in the matrix is isolated based on its surrounding elements.

## Installation

To run the Matrix Isolation software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the software code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The software does not have any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. You can run the software directly without additional installations.

## How to Use the Software

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the program.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Matrix Dimensions**: When prompted, enter the dimensions of the matrix (H for rows and W for columns) as space-separated integers. For example:
   ```
   Enter matrix dimensions (H W): 3 3
   ```

3. **Input the Matrix**: Next, enter the matrix rows, ensuring that each row contains the correct number of space-separated integer values. For example:
   ```
   Enter the matrix rows (space-separated values):
   1 0 1
   0 0 0
   1 1 1
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the matrix, the program will process the input and display whether it is possible to achieve a non-isolated matrix and the minimum number of operations required. For example:
   ```
   Possible: True, Operations: 1
   ```

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the software:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the following when prompted:
   ```
   Enter matrix dimensions (H W): 3 3
   Enter the matrix rows (space-separated values):
   1 0 1
   0 0 0
   1 1 1
   ```

3. The output will be:
   ```
   Possible: True, Operations: 1
   ```

## Conclusion

The Matrix Isolation software provides a straightforward way to analyze matrix configurations and determine the necessary operations to ensure no elements are isolated. For further assistance or to report issues, please contact the support team.
