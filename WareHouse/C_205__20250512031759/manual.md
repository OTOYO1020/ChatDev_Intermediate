# Power Comparison Application

A simple application to compare the powers of two integers raised to a common exponent.

## Overview

The Power Comparison Application allows users to input two non-negative integers (A and B) and a non-negative exponent (C). It calculates A raised to the power of C and B raised to the power of C, then compares the results to determine which is greater, or if they are equal.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Accepts three non-negative integers from the user.
- **Power Calculation**: Utilizes a custom implementation of the power function to handle large integers efficiently.
- **Comparison Logic**: Compares the results of the power calculations and returns a string indicating the comparison result.

## Installation

To run the Power Comparison Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the application repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The application does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python installed correctly.

## Usage

To use the Power Comparison Application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**: When prompted, enter three non-negative integers A, B, and C separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter three non-negative integers A, B, and C separated by spaces: 2 3 4
   ```

3. **View Results**: After entering the values, the application will output the result of the comparison:
   - If A^C is greater than B^C, it will display: `A is greater`
   - If B^C is greater than A^C, it will display: `B is greater`
   - If both are equal, it will display: `A and B are equal`

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the application:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input the values:
   ```
   Enter three non-negative integers A, B, and C separated by spaces: 2 3 4
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   A is greater
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the user does not enter exactly three integers, it will prompt the user to enter the correct number of integers.
- If any of the integers are negative, it will prompt the user to enter non-negative integers.
- If the input is not a valid integer, it will prompt the user to enter valid integers.

## Conclusion

The Power Comparison Application is a straightforward tool for comparing the powers of two integers. It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy for anyone to use without extensive programming knowledge.
