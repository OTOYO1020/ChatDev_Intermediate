Task:
Define a function named compare_powers that takes three integer parameters A, B, and C. Implement the pow function to calculate the power of a number, ensuring it handles large integers correctly. Within compare_powers, calculate the value of pow(A, C) and store it in a variable named result_A. Within compare_powers, calculate the value of pow(B, C) and store it in a variable named result_B. Compare result_A and result_B to determine which is greater. Return a string indicating whether 'A is greater', 'B is greater', or 'A and B are equal' based on the comparison. Handle input by reading three integers A, B, and C from standard input. Ensure input values are within the specified constraints before proceeding with calculations. Call the compare_powers function with the input values A, B, and C. Output the result of the comparison as specified in the output format.
