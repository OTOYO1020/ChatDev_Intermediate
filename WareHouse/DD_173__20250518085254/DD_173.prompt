Define a function 'max_total_comfort(N: int, A: List[int]) -> int' to calculate the maximum total comfort for N players with their friendliness values in list A. Parse the input to extract the integer N and the list of integers A representing the friendliness of each player. Implement logic to handle the case where the first player arrives, ensuring their comfort is set to 0. Create a method to simulate the arrival of players in different orders and calculate the comfort for each player based on their positions in the circle. Determine the optimal order of arrivals that maximizes the total comfort by evaluating all possible combinations of player arrivals. Implement a way to calculate the comfort for each player based on their adjacent players' friendliness values when they arrive. Store and update the current circle of players as new players arrive, ensuring the circle structure is maintained. Optimize the algorithm to handle the upper constraint of N efficiently, possibly using a greedy or dynamic programming approach. Return the maximum total comfort calculated from the optimal order of arrivals. Format the output as an integer representing the maximum total comfort.
