# Comfort Calculation Application

This application calculates the maximum total comfort for players based on their friendliness values. It simulates the arrival of players in different orders and evaluates the optimal order to maximize comfort.

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
