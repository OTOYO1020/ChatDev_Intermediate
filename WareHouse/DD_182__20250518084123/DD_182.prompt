Define a function 'greatest_coordinate(A: List[int]) -> int' that takes a list of integers 'A' representing the number sequence. Implement input handling to read an integer 'N' (the length of the sequence) and then read the sequence 'A' of length 'N'. Initialize a variable 'current_position' to 0 to track the robot's position on the number line. Initialize a variable 'max_position' to 0 to keep track of the greatest coordinate occupied by the robot. Iterate over the elements of the list 'A' using a loop from 0 to N-1. In each iteration, update 'current_position' by adding the current element 'A[i]' to it. After updating 'current_position', check if it is greater than 'max_position' and update 'max_position' accordingly. After the loop, return the value of 'max_position' as the final result. Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as when all elements in 'A' are negative. Output the result of the function call in the format of a single integer representing the greatest coordinate occupied by the robot.
