# Robot Coordinate Calculator

A simple application to calculate the greatest coordinate occupied by a robot based on its movements represented by a sequence of integers.

## Main Functions

The Robot Coordinate Calculator provides the following main functions:

- **Input Handling**: Accepts the length of the movement sequence and the sequence itself as space-separated integers.
- **Coordinate Calculation**: Computes the greatest coordinate occupied by the robot as it moves along a number line based on the provided sequence.
- **Error Handling**: Validates user input and handles errors gracefully, providing informative messages.

## Quick Install

To run the Robot Coordinate Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip. 

```bash
pip install typing
```

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Robot Coordinate Calculator is designed to help users track the movements of a robot on a number line. By inputting a sequence of integers, users can determine the furthest point the robot reaches based on its movements. This application is useful for simulations, robotics, and educational purposes.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Length of the Sequence**: When prompted, enter the length of the sequence of movements. If there are no movements, you can enter `0`.

3. **Input the Sequence of Movements**: Enter the sequence of integers as space-separated values. For example, if the robot moves 3 units forward, then 2 units backward, you would enter `3 -2`.

4. **View the Result**: The application will calculate and display the greatest coordinate occupied by the robot.

### Example Usage

- **Input**: 
  ```
  Enter the length of the sequence (0 for no movements): 5
  Enter the sequence of integers (space-separated): 3 -1 4 -2 1
  ```

- **Output**: 
  ```
  Greatest Coordinate: 6
  ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the length of the sequence is negative, an error message will be displayed.
- If the user inputs non-integer values, an error message will indicate the invalid input.
- If the length of the sequence does not match the specified length, an error message will be shown.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

For more information on how the application works, you can refer to the source code in the `main.py` and `coordinate_calculator.py` files. The main logic for calculating the greatest coordinate is encapsulated in the `greatest_coordinate` function.
