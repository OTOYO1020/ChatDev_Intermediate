Task:
Define the function 'process_queries(N: int, Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, Union[Tuple[int, int], Tuple[int, int]]]])' to handle the input parameters N (number of vertices), Q (number of queries), and a list of queries. Initialize an adjacency list 'graph' to represent the undirected graph with N vertices. Iterate through the list of queries and for each query, determine its type (1 or 2). For Type 1 queries, extract vertices u and v, and add an edge between them in the 'graph' adjacency list. For Type 2 queries, extract vertex v and integer k, and retrieve the list of vertices connected to v from the 'graph'. Sort the list of connected vertices in descending order to find the k-th largest vertex. Check if the number of connected vertices is less than k; if so, prepare to output -1. If there are enough connected vertices, retrieve the k-th largest vertex from the sorted list. Store the results of Type 2 queries in a list to be printed later. Output all results from Type 2 queries at once after processing all queries.
