# Count Ways Application

The Count Ways Application is designed to calculate the number of ways to reach a specific cell in a sequence of cells, given certain segments that define valid moves. This application utilizes a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the result based on user-defined parameters.

## Main Functions

- **Input Parameters**: The application allows users to input:
  - `N`: The total number of cells.
  - `K`: The number of segments.
  - `segments`: A list of segments defined by pairs of integers (L, R) that indicate the range of valid moves.

- **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The application calculates the number of ways to reach cell `N` from cell `1` using the defined segments.

- **Output**: The application displays the number of ways to reach cell `N`, modulo `998244353`.

## Installation

To run the Count Ways Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where the application files are located and run the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**:
   - Enter the value for `N` (the total number of cells).
   - Enter the value for `K` (the number of segments).
   - Input the segments in the format `(L R)` separated by commas. For example: `1 3, 2 4`.

3. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to compute the number of ways to reach cell `N`.

4. **View Result**: The result will be displayed below the input fields, showing the number of ways to reach cell `N`.

## Example Usage

- **Input**:
  - N: `5`
  - K: `2`
  - Segments: `1 2, 2 5`

- **Output**: The application will display the number of ways to reach cell `5` based on the provided segments.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any input errors, a message box will appear indicating the issue. Ensure that:
  - `N` and `K` are positive integers.
  - Each segment is defined correctly with two integers.
  - The segments are within the bounds of `1` to `N`.

## Conclusion

The Count Ways Application provides a user-friendly interface for calculating the number of ways to navigate through a series of cells based on defined segments. With its dynamic programming approach, it efficiently computes results while ensuring input validation for a smooth user experience.
