Define the function 'count_remaining_cookies(H: int, W: int, cookies: List[List[str]]) -> int' to handle the input parameters. Create a 2D list 'cookies' to store the color of each cookie based on the input format. Implement a loop to iterate through each row of the 'cookies' list and check for marked cookies based on the color count. Within the row iteration, if two or more cookies of the same color are found, mark them in a separate list or set. Implement a loop to iterate through each column of the 'cookies' list and check for marked cookies based on the color count. Within the column iteration, if two or more cookies of the same color are found, mark them in the same list or set as in the row iteration. After checking both rows and columns, if any cookies are marked, remove them from the 'cookies' list and repeat the process. Continue the process until no cookies are marked in either rows or columns. Count the remaining cookies in the 'cookies' list after the procedure terminates. Return the count of remaining cookies as the output of the function.
