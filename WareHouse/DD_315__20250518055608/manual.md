# Cookie Counter

A simple application to count remaining cookies after marking duplicates based on color.

## Introduction

The Cookie Counter application allows users to input a grid of cookies represented by their colors. The application processes this grid to identify and remove cookies that have duplicates in either rows or columns. The final output is the count of remaining cookies after all duplicates have been marked and removed.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Accepts a grid of cookies in a user-friendly format.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Iterates through rows and columns to identify cookies with duplicate colors.
- **Cookie Removal**: Removes marked cookies from the grid until no duplicates remain.
- **Remaining Count**: Returns the count of cookies that remain after the removal process.

2. **Input Format**:
