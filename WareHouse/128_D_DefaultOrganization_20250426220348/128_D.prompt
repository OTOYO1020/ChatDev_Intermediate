Input Handling: Read integers \( N \) and \( K \) from standard input, followed by the list of integers \( V \) representing the values of the jewels in the dequeue \( D \). Store these values in variables 'N', 'K', and a list 'V'. Initialize Variables: Create a variable 'max_sum' to keep track of the maximum sum of jewel values in hand. Initialize it to zero. Simulate Operations: Implement a function 'simulate_operations(V, N, K)' to explore all possible combinations of operations A and B up to \( K \) times. Iterate Over Possible Operations: Within 'simulate_operations', iterate over all possible numbers of operations \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a + b \leq K \) and \( a, b \leq N \). Here, \( a \) represents the number of times Operation A is performed, and \( b \) represents the number of times Operation B is performed. Collect Jewels: For each combination of \( a \) and \( b \), collect jewels from the left and right ends of \( D \) into a temporary list 'hand'. Specifically, take the first \( a \) jewels from the left and the last \( b \) jewels from the right. Optimize Jewel Selection: Implement a function 'optimize_jewels(hand, remaining_operations)' to maximize the sum of jewel values in 'hand' by potentially discarding some jewels. The number of jewels that can be discarded is 'remaining_operations = K - (a + b)'. Calculate Maximum Sum: In 'optimize_jewels', sort the jewels in 'hand' by value and discard the jewels with the lowest values if 'remaining_operations' allows. Calculate the sum of the remaining jewels. Update Maximum Sum: Compare the calculated sum from 'optimize_jewels' with 'max_sum' and update 'max_sum' if the new sum is greater. Return Result: After exploring all combinations of operations, return 'max_sum' from 'simulate_operations'. Output: Print the value of 'max_sum', which represents the maximum possible sum of the values of jewels in your hands after performing the operations.
