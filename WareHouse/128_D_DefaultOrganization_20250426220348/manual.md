# Jewel Collector

Welcome to the Jewel Collector application, a fun and engaging game where you can collect jewels by performing a series of operations. This manual will guide you through the main functions of the software, how to install the necessary environment dependencies, and how to use the application effectively.

## Main Functions

The Jewel Collector application allows users to:

1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of jewels (N), the number of operations (K), and the values of the jewels.
2. **Simulate Operations**: Explore all possible combinations of operations to collect jewels from both ends of a deque.
3. **Optimize Jewel Selection**: Maximize the sum of jewel values by potentially discarding some jewels based on the number of remaining operations.
4. **Calculate Maximum Sum**: Determine the maximum possible sum of jewel values after performing the operations.

## Installation

To run the Jewel Collector application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Jewel Collector application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies required, you can install them using pip. For this application, no external libraries are needed beyond Python's standard library.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:
   - **Number of Jewels (N)**: Enter an integer representing the total number of jewels.
   - **Number of Operations (K)**: Enter an integer representing the maximum number of operations you can perform.
   - **Jewel Values**: Enter the values of the jewels as a comma-separated list of integers.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the number of jewels (N): 5
   Enter the number of operations (K): 3
   Enter jewel values (comma-separated integers): 1,2,3,4,5
   ```

3. **View Results**: After processing the input, the application will output the maximum sum of the values of jewels you can collect based on the operations performed.

   Example output:
   ```
   Maximum Sum: 9
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for invalid inputs. If you enter non-integer values or if the number of jewel values does not match the specified N, the application will display an error message and prompt you to enter the data again.

## Conclusion

Thank you for using the Jewel Collector application! We hope you enjoy collecting jewels and maximizing your score. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out.

Happy collecting!
