Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of strings. Initialize a list 'strings' to store the N strings read from input. For each string, read it and append it to the 'strings' list. Determine the maximum length M of the strings in 'strings'. Initialize a list 'result' with M empty strings, each representing a vertical line of characters. For each string 'S_i' in 'strings' (from 1 to N):\n   - For each character in 'S_i' (from 1 to |S_i|):\n     - Place the character in the appropriate position in 'result' such that the (N-i+1)-th character of 'T_j' corresponds to the j-th character of 'S_i'. For each string 'T_j' in 'result' (from 1 to M):\n   - If the length of 'T_j' is less than N, fill the remaining characters with '*' to ensure it does not end with '*'. Ensure that each 'T_j' does not end with '*' by trimming any trailing '*' characters. Print each string 'T_j' from the 'result' list. Ensure the output format is correct, with each string printed on a new line.
