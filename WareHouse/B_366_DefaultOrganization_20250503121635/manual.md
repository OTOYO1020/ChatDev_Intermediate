# String Processing Application

Transforming strings into a vertical format for enhanced readability.

## Quick Install

To run the string processing application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not have a `requirements.txt` file, you can run the application without additional dependencies as it only requires Python's standard library.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The String Processing Application allows users to input multiple strings and outputs them in a vertical format. This is particularly useful for visualizing strings in a columnar layout, making it easier to compare and analyze them.

### Main Functions

- **Input Strings**: Users can input a specified number of strings.
- **Vertical Formatting**: The application processes the strings and aligns them vertically.
- **Filling Short Strings**: If a string is shorter than the maximum length, the application fills the remaining space with asterisks (`*`).
- **Output**: The processed strings are printed in a vertical format, ensuring no trailing asterisks.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file `main.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Strings**: When prompted, enter the integer value representing the number of strings you wish to input.

   ```
   Enter the number of strings: 3
   ```

3. **Input Each String**: You will then be prompted to enter each string one by one.

   ```
   Enter string 1: Hello
   Enter string 2: World
   Enter string 3: Python
   ```

4. **View the Results**: After entering all strings, the application will process them and display the results in a vertical format.

   ```
   Results:
   H* 
   e* 
   l* 
   l* 
   o* 
   W* 
   o* 
   r* 
   l* 
   d* 
   P 
   y 
   t 
   h 
   o 
   n 
   ```

### Note

- Ensure that you enter valid strings and an integer for the number of strings.
- The application handles errors gracefully, providing feedback if the input is invalid.
