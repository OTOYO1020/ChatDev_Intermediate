Read integers N and Q from standard input. Read the list of integers P, representing the person standing at each position from 1 to N. For each query from 1 to Q:\n   - Read integers A_i and B_i.\n   - Determine the person number standing further to the front between positions A_i and B_i. Print the result for each query on a new line.\n\nFunction to be called:\n- Use a function 'find_front_person(P, A_i, B_i)' to determine which person is further to the front.\n\nOutput format:\n- Each result should be printed on a new line corresponding to each query.
