# Front Person Determination Software

This software is designed to determine which person is standing further to the front between two specified positions in a line of people. It reads a list of integers representing persons standing at each position and processes multiple queries to find the desired results.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers N (number of persons) and Q (number of queries) from standard input.
- **List of Persons**: Reads a list of integers P, where each integer represents a person standing at each position from 1 to N.
- **Query Processing**: For each query, reads two integers A_i and B_i, and determines which person is further to the front between the two specified positions.
- **Output**: Prints the result for each query on a new line.

## Installation

To run this software, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the software files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment (optional)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: The `requirements.txt` file is currently empty, but you can add any necessary libraries in the future.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the program.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: When prompted, provide the following inputs:
   - First line: Two integers N and Q, separated by a space.
   - Second line: A list of N integers representing the persons standing at each position.
   - Next Q lines: Each line should contain two integers A_i and B_i, representing the positions to compare.

   Example Input:
   ```
   5 3
   1 2 3 4 5
   1 3
   2 5
   4 4
   ```

3. **Output**: The program will output the person number standing further to the front for each query on a new line.

   Example Output:
   ```
   1
   2
   4
   ```

## Error Handling

- The program checks if the length of the list of persons matches the expected count N. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- It also validates the positions A and B to ensure they are within the valid range. If they are out of range, a `ValueError` is raised.

## Conclusion

This software provides a simple yet effective way to determine which person is standing further to the front in a line based on user-defined queries. For any further questions or support, please reach out to the development team.
