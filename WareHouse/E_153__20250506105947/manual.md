# Spell Caster

A Python application designed to calculate the minimum Magic Points consumed to defeat a monster using various spells.

## Introduction

The Spell Caster application allows users to input a monster's health and a set of spells, each with specific damage values and Magic Points costs. The application calculates the most efficient way to reduce the monster's health to zero or below, minimizing the total Magic Points consumed in the process.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Monster's Health and Spells**: Users can input the monster's health and the number of spells available.
2. **Spell Management**: Users can define spells by specifying their damage and cost.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The application calculates the minimum Magic Points required to defeat the monster using the most efficient spells based on their cost-to-damage ratio.

## Installation

To run the Spell Caster application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   There are currently no external dependencies required for this project. However, if you wish to use any libraries in the future, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file.

   To create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Input Monster's Health**: When prompted, enter the integer value for the monster's health (H).
2. **Input Number of Spells**: Enter the integer value for the number of spells (N) you wish to define.
3. **Define Spells**: For each spell, input the damage and cost as space-separated integers. Ensure both values are greater than zero.
   - Example Input: `50 10` (where 50 is the damage and 10 is the cost).
4. **View Results**: After entering all spells, the application will calculate and display the minimum Magic Points consumed to defeat the monster.

## Example Usage

```
Enter Monster's Health (H): 100
Enter Number of Spells (N): 3
Enter Spell 1 Damage and Cost (space-separated): 30 5
Enter Spell 2 Damage and Cost (space-separated): 20 3
Enter Spell 3 Damage and Cost (space-separated): 10 1
Minimum Magic Points Consumed: 15
```

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Explore the possibility of adding more complex spell interactions or effects.
