Task:
Read the integer values for monster's health 'H' and the number of spells 'N' from standard input. Initialize two arrays: 'A' for spell damage values and 'B' for corresponding Magic Points costs. Read the 'N' pairs of integers (A_i, B_i) and populate the arrays 'A' and 'B'. Create a list of tuples combining spell damage and cost: 'spells = [(A[i], B[i]) for i in range(N)]'. Sort the 'spells' list based on the cost per damage ratio (B[i] / A[i]) in ascending order. Initialize a variable 'total_cost' to zero to keep track of the total Magic Points consumed. While 'H' is greater than 0, iterate through the sorted 'spells' list:\n   - For each spell, calculate how many times it needs to be cast to reduce 'H' to 0 or below.\n   - Update 'H' and 'total_cost' accordingly. Once 'H' is 0 or below, finalize the total cost. Print the 'total_cost' as the minimum Magic Points consumed to win.
