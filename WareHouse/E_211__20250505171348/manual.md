# White Square Combination Checker

A Python application for selecting and validating combinations of white squares in a grid.

## Overview

This application allows users to input a grid of squares represented by `.` (white) and `#` (black). The user can specify how many white squares they want to select, and the application will check how many valid combinations of those squares are connected.

## Main Functions

- **Input Grid**: Users can input a grid of size N x N, where each element is either `.` or `#`.
- **Select Squares**: Users can specify the number K, which indicates how many white squares they want to select.
- **Check Connectivity**: The application checks if the selected squares are connected using Depth-First Search (DFS).
- **Count Valid Combinations**: The application counts and outputs the number of valid combinations of K connected white squares.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application requires the following Python packages:

- No external dependencies are required beyond the standard library.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the application code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application directly using Python.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Input Grid Size**: When prompted, enter the grid size (N). This should be a positive integer.
   ```
   Enter grid size (N): 4
   ```

2. **Input Number of Squares**: Enter the number of squares to select (K). This should be a positive integer less than or equal to N*N.
   ```
   Enter number of squares to select (K): 2
   ```

3. **Input Grid Representation**: Enter the grid representation, using `.` for white squares and `#` for black squares. Each row should be of length N.
   ```
   Enter grid (use '.' for white and '#' for black):
   .#..
   ..#.
   #...
   .#..
   ```

4. **View Results**: The application will output the number of valid combinations of K connected white squares.
   ```
   Number of valid combinations: 1
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If N is not a positive integer.
- If K is not a positive integer or greater than N*N.
- If any row of the grid is not of length N or contains invalid characters.
- If there are not enough white squares to form combinations of the specified size.
- If there are no white squares available in the grid.

In case of an error, the application will print an appropriate message to the standard error output.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to analyze combinations of white squares in a grid. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and run the application to explore different grid configurations and their valid combinations.
