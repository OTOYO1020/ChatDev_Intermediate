Task:
Read integers N and K from standard input. Read the grid representation S of size N x N, where each element is either '#' or '.'. Initialize a list to store the coordinates of all white squares (i.e., those represented by '.'). Generate all combinations of K white squares from the list of white square coordinates. For each combination, check if the selected squares are connected:\n   - Implement a function 'is_connected(selected_squares)' that uses BFS or DFS to verify connectivity. Count the number of valid combinations where the squares are connected. Print the count of valid combinations as the output.
