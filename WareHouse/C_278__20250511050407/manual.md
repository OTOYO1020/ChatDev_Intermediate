## ü§î What is Gomoku?

Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a traditional board game played with black and white stones. Players take turns placing their stones on a grid, aiming to be the first to get five of their stones in a row.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Game Interface**: The game will display the current state of the board in the console. Empty spaces are represented by dots (.), while black and white stones are represented by their initials (B for black and W for white).

3. **Making a Move**: When it's your turn, you will be prompted to enter the row and column where you want to place your stone. The valid range for both row and column is from 0 to 14. For example, to place a stone in the center of the board, you would enter:
   ```
   7 7
   ```

4. **Winning the Game**: The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player aligns five stones in a row, the game will announce the winner.

5. **Draw Condition**: If the board is full and no player has won, the game will declare a draw.

6. **Play Again**: After the game ends, you will be prompted to play again. Enter 'y' to restart or 'n' to exit.
