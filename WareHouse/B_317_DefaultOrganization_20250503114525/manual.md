# Lost Integer Calculator

A simple application to find the lost integer from a sequence of consecutive integers.

## Overview

The Lost Integer Calculator reads an integer N and a list of N integers. It calculates the expected sum of the first N+1 consecutive integers and compares it to the actual sum of the provided integers to determine the lost integer.

## Main Functions

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input for N and the list of integers is valid.
- **Lost Integer Calculation**: Computes the expected and actual sums to find the lost integer.
- **Output**: Displays the lost integer.

## Installation

To run the Lost Integer Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment Dependencies

This application does not require any external libraries beyond Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application using the command line. Make sure you are in the directory where `main.py` is located.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: The application expects two lines of input:
   - The first line should contain a single integer N (the number of integers in the list).
   - The second line should contain N space-separated integers.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   1 2 3 4 6
   ```

4. **Output**: After entering the input, the application will calculate and print the lost integer.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   5
   ```

## Error Handling

If the input is invalid, the application will print an error message and exit. Common errors include:
- N is not a positive integer.
- The number of integers provided does not match N.
- Any of the integers provided are not valid positive integers.

## Conclusion

The Lost Integer Calculator is a straightforward tool for identifying missing integers in a sequence. It is designed for ease of use and quick calculations. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
