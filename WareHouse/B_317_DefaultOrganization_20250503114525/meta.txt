Task:
Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of remaining integers. Read the list of integers A from standard input, which contains N integers. Calculate the expected sum of the first N+1 consecutive integers using the formula: 'expected_sum = (N + 1) * (N + 2) / 2'. Calculate the actual sum of the integers in the list A using 'actual_sum = sum(A)'. Determine the lost integer by subtracting the actual sum from the expected sum: 'lost_integer = expected_sum - actual_sum'. Print the value of 'lost_integer'.\n\n### Input Format\n- The input consists of two lines: the first line contains the integer N, and the second line contains N space-separated integers representing the list A.\n\n### Output Format\n- The output should be a single integer, which is the lost integer.
