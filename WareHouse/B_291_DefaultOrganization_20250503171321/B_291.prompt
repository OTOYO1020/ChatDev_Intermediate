Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of judges to invalidate from both the highest and lowest grades. Read the grades from the 5N judges into a list 'grades' of length 5N. Sort the 'grades' list in ascending order to facilitate the removal of the highest and lowest grades. Remove the highest N grades from the 'grades' list by slicing the last N elements. Remove the lowest N grades from the 'grades' list by slicing the first N elements. Calculate the sum of the remaining grades in the 'grades' list, which now contains 3N elements. Compute Takahashi's score as the average of the remaining grades by dividing the sum by 3N. Print the score formatted to a floating-point number.\n\nFunction to handle the input and output:\n- The function to be called will be 'calculate_score(N, grades)' where 'N' is the number of judges and 'grades' is the list of grades. \n\nOutput format:\n- The output will be a single floating-point number representing Takahashi's score.
