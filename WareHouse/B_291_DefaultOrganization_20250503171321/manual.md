# Takahashi Score Calculator

A simple application to calculate Takahashi's score based on judges' grades by invalidating the highest and lowest grades.

## Main Functions

The Takahashi Score Calculator performs the following main functions:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads the number of judges (N) and their grades from standard input.
2. **Grade Validation**: Ensures that the input grades are valid integers and that the correct number of grades is provided.
3. **Score Calculation**: Computes Takahashi's score by removing the highest and lowest N grades and averaging the remaining grades.
4. **Output**: Displays the calculated score formatted to two decimal places.

## Installation

To run the Takahashi Score Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the source code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If there are any additional dependencies required, you can install them using pip. For this application, no external libraries are needed, but ensure you have the standard Python library.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the Number of Judges**: When prompted, enter a positive integer (N) representing the number of judges whose grades you want to invalidate.

3. **Input the Grades**: Next, you will be prompted to enter exactly `5 * N` grades separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Please enter exactly 15 grades separated by spaces (e.g., '85 90 78 92 88'): 85 90 78 92 88 76 95 89 84 91 80 82 87 93 88
   ```

4. **View the Result**: After entering the grades, the application will calculate Takahashi's score and display it formatted to two decimal places. For example:
   ```
   87.33
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input scenarios:

- If the input for N is not a positive integer, an error message will be displayed.
- If the grades input is empty or does not contain the correct number of grades, appropriate error messages will guide the user to correct their input.
- If any grades are negative, the application will prompt the user to enter valid non-negative integers.
