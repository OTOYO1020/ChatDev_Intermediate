# Board Game Solver User Manual

## Introduction

The Board Game Solver is a software application developed in Java that helps players solve complex board game scenarios by providing optimal moves and strategies. It analyzes the current state of the game board and takes into account various factors such as player positions, resources, and available actions. The solver algorithm calculates the best possible moves for each player, considering both short-term gains and long-term strategies. It provides step-by-step instructions and visualizations to guide players through the optimal gameplay.

## Installation

To use the Board Game Solver, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can download and install Java from the official website: [Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

Once Java is installed, you can proceed with the following steps to run the application:

1. Download the Board Game Solver source code from the provided link.

2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a directory of your choice.

3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the extracted directory.

4. Compile the Java source code by running the following command:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```

5. Run the application by executing the following command:
   ```
   java Main
   ```

## Usage

Upon running the application, a graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear. The GUI provides the main interface for interacting with the Board Game Solver.

### GUI Overview

The GUI consists of the following components:

- Main Window: The main window of the application where the game board and instructions are displayed.

- Click Me Button: A button that triggers a message dialog when clicked.

### Game Board Display

The game board is displayed in the center of the main window. It represents the current state of the game board, including player positions and resources. The game board is updated dynamically based on the solver algorithm's calculations.

### Instructions Display

The instructions for each player are displayed in the console window. The console window shows the textual instructions on what actions to take. Each player's instructions are displayed separately.

### Solver Algorithm

The solver algorithm calculates the best possible moves for each player based on the current state of the game board. It takes into account various factors such as player positions, resources, and available actions. The algorithm considers both short-term gains and long-term strategies to determine the optimal moves.

### Interacting with the Application

To interact with the Board Game Solver, you can perform the following actions:

1. Click the "Click Me" button: This will trigger a message dialog displaying the message "Hello, World!". This action is for demonstration purposes and does not affect the solver algorithm.

2. Observe the game board: The game board is displayed visually in the main window. It represents the current state of the game board, including player positions and resources. The game board is updated dynamically based on the solver algorithm's calculations.

3. Observe the instructions: The instructions for each player are displayed in the console window. The console window shows the textual instructions on what actions to take. Each player's instructions are displayed separately.

## Conclusion

The Board Game Solver is a powerful tool for players who want to solve complex board game scenarios and make optimal moves. It provides step-by-step instructions and visualizations to guide players through the optimal gameplay. By analyzing the current state of the game board and considering various factors, the solver algorithm calculates the best possible moves for each player, taking into account both short-term gains and long-term strategies.
