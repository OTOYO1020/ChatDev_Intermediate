# Repunits Sum Finder

A Python application designed to find the N-th smallest sum of combinations of three repunits.

## Introduction

Repunits are numbers that consist solely of the digit '1'. This application allows users to input an integer N (between 1 and 333) and calculates the N-th smallest sum of unique combinations of three repunits. The application is built to handle user input gracefully and provides informative error messages when necessary.

## Main Functions

- **generate_repunits(limit: int) -> List[int]**: Generates a list of repunits up to a specified limit. A repunit is a number consisting of only the digit '1'.
  
- **find_nth_repunits_sum(N: int) -> int**: Finds the N-th smallest sum of unique combinations of three repunits. It utilizes the `generate_repunits` function to create the necessary repunits and calculates their sums.

## Installation

To run the Repunits Sum Finder application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   # Add any required libraries here
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the application**:
   Execute the main application file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input your value for N**:
   When prompted, enter an integer value for N (between 1 and 333). The application will validate your input and proceed to calculate the result.

3. **View the result**:
   The application will output the N-th smallest sum in the format:
   ```
   The N-th smallest sum is: {result}
   ```

   If there are not enough unique sums to find the N-th smallest sum, the application will inform you:
   ```
   Not enough unique sums to find the N-th smallest sum.
   ```

## Example Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input a valid integer:
   ```
   Enter N (1-333): 5
   ```

3. Output:
   ```
   The 5-th smallest sum is: 1111
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the input is not an integer, the application will prompt:
  ```
  Invalid input. Please enter an integer.
  ```

- If the input integer is outside the range of 1 to 333, the application will prompt:
  ```
  Please enter a number between 1 and 333.
  ```

## Conclusion

The Repunits Sum Finder is a straightforward application that efficiently calculates the N-th smallest sum of combinations of three repunits. It is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear feedback for various input scenarios.
