Read integers H, W, and K from standard input. Read H strings \( S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_H \) representing the grid, where each string has a length of W. Initialize a 2D list 'grid' to store the characters from the strings. Create a function 'count_operations_to_consecutive_o(row, start_col)' that counts the number of operations needed to convert a horizontal sequence of K cells starting from '(row, start_col)' to all 'o'. Create a function 'count_operations_to_consecutive_o_vertical(start_row, col)' that counts the number of operations needed to convert a vertical sequence of K cells starting from '(start_row, col)' to all 'o'. Loop through each row and call 'count_operations_to_consecutive_o(row, j)' for each valid starting column \( j \) (from 1 to \( W-K+1 \)). Loop through each column and call 'count_operations_to_consecutive_o_vertical(i, col)' for each valid starting row \( i \) (from 1 to \( H-K+1 \)). Track the minimum number of operations required across all horizontal and vertical checks. If no valid configuration can be achieved, set the result to -1; otherwise, set it to the minimum operations found. Print the result.
