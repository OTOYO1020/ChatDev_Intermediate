# Grid Converter

A Python application for converting grid sequences to consecutive 'o' characters.

## Overview

The Grid Converter application allows users to input a grid of characters and calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert horizontal or vertical sequences of characters into consecutive 'o' characters. The application is designed to handle grids of varying sizes and configurations.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads integers H (height), W (width), and K (length of sequence) from standard input, along with H strings representing the grid.
- **Operation Counting**: Contains functions to count the number of operations needed to convert sequences of K cells to 'o' both horizontally and vertically.
- **Minimum Operations Calculation**: Loops through the grid to find the minimum number of operations required across all valid configurations.
- **Output**: Prints the minimum number of operations required or -1 if no valid configuration can be achieved.

## Installation

To run the Grid Converter application, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

The application does not require any external libraries beyond the standard Python library. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file using Python.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**:
   - First, input three integers separated by spaces: H (height), W (width), and K (length of sequence).
   - Next, input H strings, each of length W, representing the grid. Each string can only contain characters 'o' and 'x'.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   3 5 3
   ooxoo
   xoxox
   oooxo
   ```

4. **Output**: The application will print the minimum number of operations required to convert the grid or -1 if no valid configuration can be achieved.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python main.py
3 5 3
ooxoo
xoxox
oooxo
```

**Output**:
```
2
```

This indicates that a minimum of 2 operations are needed to convert a sequence of 3 cells to 'o'.

## Error Handling

- The application checks for valid input and will return error messages for:
  - Invalid integers for H, W, and K.
  - Empty grid input.
  - Rows not matching the specified width.
  - Invalid characters in the grid.
