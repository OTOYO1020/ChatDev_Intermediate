Task:
Define the function 'min_cost_to_rearrange_boxes(N: int, A: List[int], W: List[int])' to handle the input parameters where N is the number of boxes/items, A is the list of box numbers for each item, and W is the list of weights for each item. Parse the input to extract the values of N, A, and W from the input format. Create a data structure (like a dictionary or list) to track the items in each box based on the input list A. Calculate the total weight of items in each box and determine how many items are in each box. Identify boxes that contain more than one item and boxes that are empty. For each box with excess items, calculate the cost of moving items to empty boxes based on their weights. Implement a strategy to minimize the total cost by prioritizing moves based on item weights. Keep track of the total cost incurred during the movements of items between boxes. Ensure that after all operations, each box contains exactly one item. Return the total minimum cost as the output of the function.
