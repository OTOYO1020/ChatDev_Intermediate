# Box Rearrangement Dashboard

The Box Rearrangement Dashboard is a Python application designed to help users efficiently rearrange boxes based on item weights and box numbers. The application calculates the minimum cost required to ensure that each box contains exactly one item, optimizing the movement of items between boxes.

## Main Functions

- **Input Fields**: Users can input the number of boxes (N), the list of box numbers (A), and the list of weights (W) for each item.
- **Calculate Minimum Cost**: The application processes the input data and calculates the minimum cost required to rearrange the boxes so that each box contains exactly one item.
- **Error Handling**: The application provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

## Installation

To run the Box Rearrangement Dashboard, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

   Note: `tkinter` is included with most Python installations, but if you encounter issues, ensure it is installed.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `main.py` file to start the Box Rearrangement Dashboard.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**:
   - Enter the number of boxes (N) in the first input field.
   - Enter the box numbers (A) in the second input field, separated by commas (e.g., `1,2,1,3`).
   - Enter the weights (W) in the third input field, separated by commas (e.g., `10,20,30,40`).

3. **Calculate Minimum Cost**: Click the "Calculate Min Cost" button to process the input data. The application will display the minimum cost required to rearrange the boxes.

4. **Error Handling**: If there are any errors in the input data (e.g., invalid numbers, mismatched lengths), the application will show an error message.

## Example Usage

- **Input**:
  - Number of Boxes (N): `4`
  - Box Numbers (A): `1,2,1,3`
  - Weights (W): `10,20,30,40`

- **Output**: The application will calculate and display the minimum cost required to rearrange the boxes.

## Conclusion

The Box Rearrangement Dashboard is a powerful tool for managing box arrangements based on item weights. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily calculate the minimum cost for rearranging their boxes efficiently.
