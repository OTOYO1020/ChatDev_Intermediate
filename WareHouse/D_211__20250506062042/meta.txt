Task:
Read integers N and M from standard input, representing the number of cities and roads respectively. Initialize an adjacency list 'graph' to represent the roads between cities. For each road i from 1 to M, read the pair (A_i, B_i) and update the 'graph' to include both directions (A_i to B_i and B_i to A_i). Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from City 1 to City N. During the search, maintain a 'distance' array to track the shortest distance to each city. Also, maintain a 'count' array to track the number of ways to reach each city with the shortest distance. For each city reached, update the 'count' based on the number of ways to reach the previous city if the current path is the shortest. After completing the search, the result will be in 'count[N]', which represents the number of shortest paths from City 1 to City N. Print the result modulo (10^9 + 7).\n\nThis breakdown provides a clear path to implementing the solution by defining the necessary steps and data structures.
