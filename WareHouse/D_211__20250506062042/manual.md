# City Graph Shortest Path Application

This application allows users to find the shortest paths between cities represented as nodes in a graph, based on the roads connecting them. It implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to calculate the number of shortest paths from City 1 to City N.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of cities (N) and roads (M) from standard input.
- **Graph Representation**: Initializes an adjacency list to represent the roads between cities.
- **Road Addition**: Allows adding roads between cities while preventing self-loops and duplicate roads.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Implements BFS to find the shortest path from City 1 to City N, while also counting the number of distinct shortest paths.
- **Output**: Prints the number of shortest paths modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Installation Instructions

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Dependencies

This application uses the following Python standard libraries:
- `collections` (for deque and defaultdict)

No additional dependencies are required beyond the standard Python installation.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: You can run the application by executing the `main.py` file. The application expects input in a specific format.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Format**: Provide the input in the following format:
   - The first line should contain an integer N (number of cities).
   - The second line should contain an integer M (number of roads).
   - The next M lines should each contain two integers A and B, representing a road between city A and city B.

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   5
   6
   1 2
   1 3
   2 3
   2 4
   3 4
   4 5
   ```

4. **Output**: After providing the input, the application will process the data and print the number of shortest paths from City 1 to City N.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   2
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various input scenarios:
- If N or M is not a positive integer, an error message will be displayed.
- If the number of roads exceeds the maximum possible roads in a simple undirected graph, an error message will be displayed.
- If roads are added incorrectly (self-loops or duplicates), appropriate error messages will be shown.

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to analyze city connectivity and find the shortest paths between them. For any issues or feature requests, please reach out to the development team.
