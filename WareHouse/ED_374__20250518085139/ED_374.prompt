Define the function 'max_production_capacity(N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int], P: List[int], Q: List[int], X: int) -> int' to calculate the maximum achievable production capacity. Parse the input values for N, A, B, P, Q, and X from the standard input format. Initialize a variable 'max_capacity' to store the maximum achievable production capacity, starting from zero. Iterate over each process 'i' from 1 to N and calculate the maximum number of machines of type S and T that can be purchased within the budget X. For each process 'i', calculate the production capacity 'W_i' based on the number of machines purchased and their respective processing rates A_i and B_i. Store the production capacities 'W_i' in a list and compute the minimum production capacity across all processes. Update 'max_capacity' if the computed minimum production capacity is greater than the current 'max_capacity'. Ensure that the budget is not exceeded when calculating the number of machines to purchase for each process. Return the value of 'max_capacity' as the result of the function. Output the result in the specified format after calling the function.
