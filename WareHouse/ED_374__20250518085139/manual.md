# Production Capacity Calculator

A tool for calculating the maximum achievable production capacity based on given parameters for multiple processes.

## Quick Install

To get started with the Production Capacity Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file that includes any necessary libraries, if applicable.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The Production Capacity Calculator is designed to help users determine the maximum production capacity achievable given a set of processes, processing rates, machine prices, and a budget. This tool is particularly useful for manufacturing and production planning.

### Main Functions

1. **max_production_capacity(N: int, A: List[int], B: List[int], P: List[int], Q: List[int], X: int) -> int**
   - This function calculates the maximum achievable production capacity based on the number of processes, processing rates for two types of machines, their prices, and the available budget.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `N`: Number of processes.
     - `A`: List of processing rates for machines of type S.
     - `B`: List of processing rates for machines of type T.
     - `P`: List of prices for machines of type S.
     - `Q`: List of prices for machines of type T.
     - `X`: Total budget available for purchasing machines.
   - **Returns:** The maximum achievable production capacity.

## ðŸ“– How to Use

1. **Run the Application**
   - Execute the `main.py` file to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Values**
   - The application will prompt you to enter the following values:
     - **Number of Processes (N):** Enter an integer representing the number of processes.
     - **Processing Rates A:** Enter a comma-separated list of integers representing the processing rates for machines of type S.
     - **Processing Rates B:** Enter a comma-separated list of integers representing the processing rates for machines of type T.
     - **Prices of Machines S:** Enter a comma-separated list of integers representing the prices for machines of type S.
     - **Prices of Machines T:** Enter a comma-separated list of integers representing the prices for machines of type T.
     - **Budget (X):** Enter an integer representing the total budget available for purchasing machines.

3. **View Results**
   - After entering the required values, the application will calculate and display the maximum production capacity.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the number of processes (N): 3
Enter processing rates A (comma-separated): 10,20,30
Enter processing rates B (comma-separated): 15,25,35
Enter prices of machines S (comma-separated): 100,200,300
Enter prices of machines T (comma-separated): 150,250,350
Enter budget (X): 1000
Maximum Production Capacity: 300
```
