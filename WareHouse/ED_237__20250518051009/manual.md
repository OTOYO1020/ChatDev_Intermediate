# Max Happiness Calculator

A Python application designed to calculate the maximum happiness achievable by traversing spaces connected by slopes based on their altitudes.

## Overview

The Max Happiness Calculator allows users to input a number of spaces, their altitudes, and the slopes connecting them. The application computes the maximum happiness that can be achieved by moving through these spaces, taking into account the changes in altitude.

## Main Functions

- **Input Parsing**: The application accepts input in a specific format and parses it to extract the number of spaces, slopes, altitudes, and their connections.
- **Graph Representation**: The slopes are represented as a graph using an adjacency list, facilitating efficient traversal.
- **Happiness Calculation**: The application calculates happiness changes based on altitude differences when moving between spaces.
- **Traversal Algorithm**: It employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the starting space, ensuring no space is revisited to avoid infinite loops.
- **Maximum Happiness Output**: The application returns the maximum happiness value found during the traversal.

## Installation

To run the Max Happiness Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/max_happiness_calculator.git
   cd max_happiness_calculator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have `pip` installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can simply run the application as it does not have external dependencies beyond the standard library.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**:
   When prompted, enter the input data in the following format:
   ```
   N M
   H1 H2 H3 ... HN
   u1 v1
   u2 v2
   ...
   uM vM
   ```
   - `N`: Number of spaces (vertices).
   - `M`: Number of slopes (edges).
   - `H`: List of altitudes for each space.
   - Each subsequent line represents a slope connecting two spaces (u, v).

   **Example Input**:
   ```
   4 3
   1 2 3 4
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   ```

3. **Output**:
   After entering the input, the application will compute and display the maximum happiness:
   ```
   Maximum Happiness: X
   ```

## Example

To see the application in action, you can use the following example input:

```
5 4
1 3 2 5 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

The output will be:
```
Maximum Happiness: 6
```

## Conclusion

The Max Happiness Calculator is a powerful tool for analyzing paths through connected spaces based on altitude changes. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily compute the maximum happiness achievable through their defined spaces and slopes.
