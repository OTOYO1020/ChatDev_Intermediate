# String Transformation Application

This application transforms a string based on specific rules, allowing users to explore string manipulation through a series of operations.

## Main Functions

The application consists of two main components:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures the input string follows the required format (characters followed by digits).
2. **String Transformation**: The function `f(S)` processes the input string according to the specified rules, repeatedly transforming the string until its length is 1 or until it stabilizes.

### Key Features

- **Input Handling**: The application reads a string from standard input, ensuring it meets the required format.
- **Transformation Logic**: The function `f(S)` constructs a new string based on the characters and their corresponding counts.
- **Operation Counting**: The application counts how many transformations are performed before reaching a stable state or a single character.
- **Error Handling**: The application gracefully handles invalid inputs and transformation errors.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the application files.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Currently, there are no external dependencies required for this application. However, you can create a `requirements.txt` file for future expansion.

   ```bash
   touch requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Main Application**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Format**: When prompted, enter a string in the format of alternating characters and digits (e.g., `a3b2c1`). Ensure that:
   - The string has an even length.
   - Each character is followed by a digit.

3. **Output**: The application will output:
   - The final transformed string when its length is 1.
   - The number of operations performed, modulo `998244353`.
   - If the input is invalid or if the string does not change after transformations, it will print `-1`.

### Example

- **Input**: `a3b2`
- **Output**: 
  ```
  Result: aaabbb
  Operations: 1
  ```

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for various scenarios:

- If the input string does not meet the required format, an error message will be displayed.
- If the transformation results in an empty string, the application will terminate with `-1`.
- If the string does not change after an iteration, the application will also terminate with `-1`.

## Conclusion

This application provides a simple yet powerful way to explore string transformations based on specified rules. By following the instructions above, users can easily set up and run the application to see the transformations in action.
