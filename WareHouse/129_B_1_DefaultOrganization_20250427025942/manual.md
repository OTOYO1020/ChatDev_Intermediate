# Minimum Absolute Difference Calculator

This application calculates the minimum absolute difference between the sums of two groups of weights based on user input. It is designed to be simple and efficient, allowing users to easily find the optimal division of weights.

## Main Functions

- **Input Handling**: The application reads an integer `N` and an array `W` of size `N` from standard input, where `W` contains the masses of weights indexed from 1 to `N`.
- **Calculation of Minimum Difference**: It computes the minimum absolute difference between the sums of two groups of weights by iterating through possible division points.
- **Output**: The application outputs the minimum absolute difference after evaluating all possible divisions.

## Installation Instructions

This application is self-contained and does not require any third-party libraries. To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If the code is hosted on a version control system like Git, clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Since there are no external dependencies, you can skip this step. However, if you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Data**: Follow the prompts to enter the number of weights (`N`) and the weights themselves. Ensure that:
   - `N` is a positive integer.
   - The weights are positive integers and match the specified size `N`.

   Example Input:
   ```
   Enter number of weights (N): 5
   Enter weights separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5
   ```

3. **View Output**: After entering the data, the application will calculate and display the minimum absolute difference between the two groups of weights.
   ```
   Minimum Absolute Difference: 1
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for input validation. If the input does not meet the specified criteria, an error message will be displayed. For example:
- If `N` is not a positive integer, it will prompt: `Input Error: N must be a positive integer.`
- If the number of weights does not match `N`, it will prompt: `Input Error: Number of weights does not match N.`
- If any weight is not a positive integer, it will prompt: `Input Error: All weights must be positive integers.`

## Conclusion

This application provides a straightforward way to calculate the minimum absolute difference between two groups of weights. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can quickly set up and run the application to meet their needs.
