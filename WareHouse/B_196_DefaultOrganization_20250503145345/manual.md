# Round Down Number Application

This application allows users to input a number as a string and receive the rounded down integer value. It validates the input to ensure it is a valid number (either an integer or a decimal) and does not contain unnecessary leading zeros.

## Main Functions

1. **Input Validation**: The application checks if the input is a valid number. It ensures that:
   - The input is not empty.
   - Negative numbers are handled correctly.
   - Leading zeros are not present in integer parts unless the number is exactly "0".
   - Decimal parts are valid if present.

2. **Rounding Down**: The application rounds down the number by discarding the decimal part if it exists, returning only the integer part.

3. **Output**: The final result is printed as a valid integer representation.

## Installation Instructions

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you have the code in a repository, clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: This application does not require any external libraries, so you can run it directly with Python.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Run the Application**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input a Number**: When prompted, enter a number as a string (e.g., `123`, `-0.5`, `0.99`, `00123`, etc.). Make sure to follow the input validation rules.

3. **View the Result**: After entering the number, the application will validate the input. If valid, it will print the rounded down integer result. If invalid, it will display an error message:
   ```
   Invalid Input: Please enter a valid number.
   ```

## Example Usage

- **Valid Input**:
   - Input: `123.456`
   - Output: `123`
   
   - Input: `-0.99`
   - Output: `0`
   
   - Input: `00123`
   - Output: `123`

- **Invalid Input**:
   - Input: `0123.45`
   - Output: `Invalid Input: Please enter a valid number.`
   
   - Input: `-`
   - Output: `Invalid Input: Please enter a valid number.`
