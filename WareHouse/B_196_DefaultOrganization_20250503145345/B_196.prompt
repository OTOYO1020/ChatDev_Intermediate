Receive the input value \( X \) as a string from standard input. Validate that \( X \) is a valid number (either an integer or a decimal) and does not contain unnecessary leading zeros. Check if \( X \) contains a decimal point:\n   - If it does, split \( X \) into the integer part and the decimal part.\n   - If it does not, treat \( X \) as an integer. Convert the integer part of \( X \) to an integer type. Round down the value by discarding the decimal part if it exists. Store the result of the rounding operation. Prepare the output format to ensure it is a valid integer representation. Print the final rounded down result.\n\nFunction to call: 'round_down(X)' where \( X \) is the input string. \n\nOutput format: The output should be a single integer value representing the rounded down result.
