# Happiness Calculator

Calculate the maximum happiness after a specified number of handshakes among guests based on their powers.

## Overview

The Happiness Calculator is a Python application designed to compute the maximum happiness derived from handshakes between guests. Each guest has a power level, and the happiness from a handshake is the sum of the power levels of the two guests involved. The application allows users to specify the number of guests, the number of handshakes, and the power levels of each guest.

## Main Functions

- **max_happiness(N: int, M: int, A: List[int]) -> int**: This function calculates the maximum happiness after M unique handshakes among N guests with given power levels in list A.

## Installation

To run the Happiness Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install typing
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: After setting up the environment, navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

2. **Execute the Script**: Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Input Parameters**: The application will prompt you to enter the following:

   - **Number of Guests (N)**: Enter an integer representing the total number of guests.
   - **Number of Handshakes (M)**: Enter an integer representing how many unique handshakes you want to perform.
   - **Powers of Guests (A)**: Enter a comma-separated list of integers representing the power levels of each guest.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the number of guests (N): 4
   Enter the number of handshakes (M): 2
   Enter the powers of guests (comma-separated integers): 1,2,3,4
   ```

4. **View Results**: After entering the inputs, the application will calculate and display the maximum happiness based on the provided parameters.

   Example output:
   ```
   Maximum Happiness: 10
   ```

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling. If the input does not meet the expected format or constraints (e.g., the number of powers does not match the number of guests), an error message will be displayed.

## Conclusion

The Happiness Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating the maximum happiness from handshakes among guests based on their power levels. By following the installation and usage instructions, users can easily set up and run the application to explore different scenarios.
