Define the function signature as 'def grid_sum(N: int, M: int, Q: int, queries: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> List[int]:' to handle the input parameters. Initialize a grid representation that can handle the size N x M without explicitly creating it, since N and M can be very large. Implement a method to calculate the value at any square (i, j) using the formula '(i-1) * M + j'. Create a function to determine if the sum of integers in a specified range (p, q) should include zeros based on the odd/even condition of (i+j). For each query, calculate the sum of integers in the specified range (A_i to B_i for rows and C_i to D_i for columns), accounting for the zeros in the grid. Implement the modulo operation with 998244353 for the results of each query to ensure the output is within the required bounds. Store the results of each query in a list to be returned at the end of the function. Ensure that the function can handle up to 200,000 queries efficiently without exceeding time limits. Test the function with edge cases, such as minimum and maximum values for N, M, and Q. Return the list of results as the output of the function.
