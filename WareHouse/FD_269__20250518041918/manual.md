# Grid Sum Application

Efficiently calculate sums in a large grid without explicitly creating it.

## Overview

The Grid Sum Application allows users to perform sum calculations on a virtual grid defined by its dimensions (N x M). The grid values are calculated using the formula `(i-1) * M + j`, and the application can handle large grids and multiple queries efficiently.

## Main Functions

- **Grid Representation**: The application initializes a grid representation that can handle large sizes without explicitly creating it.
- **Value Calculation**: Each cell's value can be calculated using the formula `(i-1) * M + j`.
- **Range Sum Queries**: Users can query the sum of values in a specified rectangular range, with the option to include or exclude zeros based on the odd/even condition of the sum of the row and column indices.
- **Modulo Operation**: All results are returned modulo `998244353` to ensure they fit within the required bounds.

## Installation

To run the Grid Sum Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install typing
```

## Usage

1. **Setup the Application**: Import the necessary classes and create an instance of `MainApp`.

2. **Input Configuration**: Use the `setup_input` method to define the grid dimensions (N, M) and the list of queries.

3. **Calculate Sums**: Call the `calculate_sum` method to process the queries and retrieve the results.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet to demonstrate how to use the application:

```python
from main import MainApp

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainApp()
    # Setup grid dimensions and queries
    app.setup_input(5, 5, [(1, 3, 1, 3), (2, 4, 2, 4)])  # Sample input
    results = app.calculate_sum()
    print(results)  # Output results
```

### Query Format

Each query should be a tuple of four integers `(A, B, C, D)` where:
- `A` is the starting row index (1-based).
- `B` is the ending row index (1-based).
- `C` is the starting column index (1-based).
- `D` is the ending column index (1-based).

### Edge Cases

The application is designed to handle edge cases, including:
- Invalid ranges (e.g., `A < 1`, `B > N`, `C < 1`, `D > M`, or `A > B`, `C > D`), which will return a sum of `0`.
- Maximum values for `N`, `M`, and `Q` to ensure performance under load.

## Conclusion

The Grid Sum Application is a powerful tool for efficiently calculating sums in large grids based on user-defined queries. By leveraging the mathematical properties of grid indexing, it avoids the need for large memory allocations while providing accurate results quickly.
