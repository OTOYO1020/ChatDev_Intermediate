Define the function 'count_possible_Y(N: int, M: int, black_pawns: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int' that takes the positive integer N, the number of black pawns M, and a list of tuples representing the positions of black pawns. Parse the input to extract the values of N and M, and the list of black pawn positions (X_i, Y_i). Ensure that the input adheres to the specified constraints. Initialize a grid representation to track the positions of black pawns based on the input list. Implement the logic to determine valid movements of the white pawn from its starting position (0, N) to the last row (2N, Y). Check the conditions for moving the white pawn downwards to (i+1, j) when there is no black pawn at that position. Check the conditions for moving the white pawn diagonally to (i+1, j+1) when there is a black pawn at that position. Check the conditions for moving the white pawn diagonally to (i+1, j-1) when there is a black pawn at that position. Count the number of valid Y positions in the last row (2N, Y) that can be reached by the white pawn after applying the movement rules. Return the count of valid Y positions as the output of the function. Ensure the output format is an integer representing the number of valid Y positions.
