The user inputs a three-digit number, and if both the number and the digit position are the same, it is a hit, and if only the number is the same but the digit position is different, it is a blow, and output the number. The number of times the user can try (life) is set to seven, and the number of remaining lives is displayed. If the user answers correctly halfway through, end the game as if they answered correctly. If the input numbers contain the same digit or a number other than three digits is entered, it is considered an incorrect input and the user is asked to enter it again. In addition, do not reduce the number of lives in that case.",
