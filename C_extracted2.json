  "300": "- Input: \"We have a grid with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Each cell in the grid has a symbol `#` or `.` written on it. We need to find the number of crosses of sizes from 1 to N, where N is the minimum of H and W.\"\n\n- Output: \n  1. **Define Input Handling**: Create a function `def count_crosses(H: int, W: int, grid: List[List[str]]) -> List[int]:` to handle the input where `H` and `W` are integers representing the dimensions of the grid, and `grid` is a 2D list containing the symbols `#` and `.`.\n  \n  2. **Initialize Variables**: Inside the function, initialize a list `S` of size `N` (where `N = min(H, W)`) to store the counts of crosses of sizes from 1 to N.\n\n  3. **Iterate Over Possible Centers**: Loop through each cell `(i, j)` in the grid where `1 ≤ i ≤ H` and `1 ≤ j ≤ W` to check for potential cross centers.\n\n  4. **Check Cross Conditions**: For each potential center `(i, j)`, check if `C[i][j]` is `#` and if the conditions for a cross of size `n` are satisfied for all `d` from `1` to `n`.\n\n  5. **Count Valid Crosses**: If a valid cross of size `n` is found, increment `S[n-1]` (to account for zero-based indexing) by 1.\n\n  6. **Boundary Checks**: Ensure that the checks for the cross do not exceed the grid boundaries by validating the indices for `C[a+d][b+d]`, `C[a+d][b-d]`, `C[a-d][b+d]`, and `C[a-d][b-d]`.\n\n  7. **Check Surrounding Cells**: For each cross of size `n`, check the surrounding cells `C[a+n+1][b+n+1]`, `C[a+n+1][b-n-1]`, `C[a-n-1][b+n+1]`, and `C[a-n-1][b-n-1]` to ensure at least one is `.`.\n\n  8. **Store Results**: After checking all potential centers for all sizes from `1` to `N`, store the results in the list `S`.\n\n  9. **Return Results**: Return the list `S` containing the counts of crosses of sizes from `1` to `N`.\n\n  10. **Output Format**: The output should be a list of integers representing the counts of crosses of sizes `1` to `N`, formatted as `print(S)` after calling the function.",
  "200": "- Input: \"Given a sequence A of N positive integers, find the pair of integers (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N and A_i - A_j is a multiple of 200.\"\n\n- Output: \n  1. **Define the function**: Create a function named `find_pairs(N: int, A: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]` to handle the input parameters.\n  2. **Input handling**: Read the integer N and the list of integers A from the input. Ensure that N is within the range [2, 200000] and each A_i is within the range [1, 10^9].\n  3. **Initialize a list**: Create an empty list named `result` to store valid pairs of indices (i, j).\n  4. **Create a dictionary**: Initialize a dictionary named `mod_map` to keep track of the indices of the integers in A based on their values modulo 200.\n  5. **Iterate through the list**: Loop through each integer A[i] in the list A using its index i (from 0 to N-1).\n  6. **Calculate modulo**: For each A[i], calculate `mod_value = A[i] % 200`.\n  7. **Check for pairs**: If `mod_value` exists in `mod_map`, iterate through the stored indices and for each index j in `mod_map[mod_value]`, check if i < j. If true, append the pair (i + 1, j + 1) to `result` (converting to 1-based indexing).\n  8. **Update the dictionary**: Append the current index i to `mod_map[mod_value]` to keep track of indices for future comparisons.\n  9. **Return results**: After processing all elements, return the `result` list containing all valid pairs (i, j).\n  10. **Output format**: Ensure the output is formatted as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a valid pair of indices (i, j)."
