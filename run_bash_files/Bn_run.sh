Loop through each character in \( S \) and update the frequency dictionary. Identify the maximum frequency value from the frequency dictionary. Create a list of characters that have the maximum frequency. Sort this list of characters in alphabetical order. Select the first character from the sorted list as the result. Print the result character.\n\nThe function to handle the frequency counting could be named 'find_most_frequent_character(S)', which will take the string \( S \) as an argument and return the character that meets the criteria. \n\nThe output format will be the character that appears most frequently in \( S \), or the earliest in alphabetical order if there are ties."
python3 run.py --name "B_245" --task "Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the length of the sequence. Read the sequence of integers A from standard input, ensuring it contains N integers. Initialize a boolean array 'present' of size 2001 to keep track of which integers from 0 to 2000 are present in A. Iterate through each integer in the sequence A:\n   - For each integer A[i], set 'present[A[i]] = True' to mark it as present. Loop through the 'present' array from index 0 to 2000:\n   - Find the first index 'i' where 'present[i]' is False. Store the value of 'i' as the smallest non-negative integer not in A. Print the result.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that we efficiently determine the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given sequence."
python3 run.py --name "B_345" --task "Receive the integer \( X \) from standard input. Validate that \( X \) is within the range of \(-10^{18}\) to \(10^{18}\). Calculate the division \( \frac{X}{10} \). Apply the ceiling function to the result of the division to get \( \left\lceil \frac{X}{10} \right\rceil \). Print the final result.\n\nFunction to call:\n- Use a function 'calculate_ceiling_division(X)' to perform the division and ceiling operation.\n\nOutput format:\n- The output will be a single integer representing \( \left\lceil \frac{X}{10} \right\rceil \)."
python3 run.py --name "B_226" --task "Read the integer N from standard input, which represents the number of sequences. Initialize a list 'sequences' to store each sequence. For each sequence index 'i' from 1 to N:\n   - Read the length 'L_i' of the sequence.\n   - Read the sequence elements 'a[i, j]' for 'j' from 1 to 'L_i' and store them in 'sequences[i]'. Convert each sequence in 'sequences' to a tuple to ensure they are hashable. Use a set 'unique_sequences' to store only unique sequences from the list of tuples. Count the number of unique sequences by determining the length of 'unique_sequences'. Print the count of unique sequences.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the input format, processes the sequences, and outputs the required result."

Use a loop to increment 'candidate' until a 326-like number is found:\n   - Call 'is_326_like(candidate)' to check if the current candidate is a 326-like number. Once a 326-like number is found, store it in a variable 'result'. Print the value of 'result' as the output."
